      body: "<p>Our agents get asked, “Do you need an inspection for homeowners insurance?” quite a bit. In many cases, you need some sort of home inspection to get a policy on your home.</p>\n<p>But you should note that there are several types of inspections that can occur during our <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting process</a>. Some are required for certain homes, and others can help you <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">lower your home insurance premium</a>. Let’s take a closer look at these inspections and when they might come into play.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinspection\">Home inspection</h2>\n<p>Most insurance companies ask for a home inspection at some point during the application process. At Kin, we ask some of our members to <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">inspect interior their own homes</a> once their coverage is bound, or confirmed. We may also require an inspection of your home’s exterior if it’s more than 10 years old. However, homes that are less than 32 years old, have masonry construction, and have roofs that are less than 15 years old are sometimes exempt from that requirement. Homes with metal or tile roofs may also be exempt.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, homeowners will have to inspect both the interior and exterior of their homes. This is usually required if your home is more than 40 years old or you need more than $1 million for <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4pointinspection\">4-point inspection</h2>\n<p>The next inspection on our list is the <a href=\"/blog/what-is-a-4-point-insurance-inspection/\">four-point inspection</a>. These are fairly common in coastal areas like Florida, and they’re generally only required on older homes. Four-point inspections don’t have standardized rules, but inspectors generally look at your home’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electrical wiring and panels.</li>\n<li>Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.</li>\n<li>Plumbing.</li>\n<li>Roof.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Four-point inspections are usually rather quick, taking only about 30 minutes to complete.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> A four-point inspection is not the same as the home inspection explained above, so one cannot be substituted for the other.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howdoesaselfinspectionwork\">How does a self-inspection work?</h3>\n<p>Our self-inspection process is powered by National Insurance Inspection Services (NIIS). NIIS sends homeowners who are required to have an inspection a text and an email with a link to complete the inspection. The inspection itself entails taking photos of various parts of the home, such as the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plumbing.</li>\n<li>Electrical.</li>\n<li>Exterior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Homeowners who do not complete the self-inspection within 7 days of receiving the link are contacted by an inspector via phone to schedule an in-person inspection.</p>\n<h2 id=\"windmitigationinspection\">Wind mitigation inspection</h2>\n<p>Florida homeowners looking to lower their insurance costs can opt for a <a href=\"/blog/the-nuts-and-bolts-of-florida-wind-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection</a>. For this inspection, you need to hire a certified inspector to come to your home and evaluate how wind resistant it is. Key features the inspector considers include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/roof-shapes/\">Roof shape</a>.</li>\n<li>Roof coverings.</li>\n<li>Roof deck.</li>\n<li>Roof deck attachment.</li>\n<li>Roof-to-wall attachments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The inspector also looks for a secondary layer of protection against rain and assesses how wind resistant your windows and doors are.</p>\n<p>Wind mitigation inspections are not required in Florida, but they are a very good idea because they can help you save money. Savings can range from a couple of hundred dollars to more than $1,000 if your home has the right mitigation features in place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roofinspection\">Roof inspection</h2>\n<p>If you read between the lines of the previous sections, you can see that roofs are top concern for most <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a>. That’s particularly true in hurricane-prone Florida, where older roofs can make it difficult to get <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a>. But new legislation helps these homeowners get coverage by demonstrating their roof has more than five years of useful life left.</p>\n<p>To qualify, homeowners must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a roof that is at least 15 years old.</li>\n<li>Use one of our <a href=\"/inspection-resources/\">authorized roof inspectors</a>.</li>\n<li>Pay for the inspection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like wind mitigation inspections, roof inspections aren’t required. You only need one if you live in Florida, have an older roof and want to get an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>.</p>"

You can request this from your monitoring company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"windmitigationinspectionreport\">Wind mitigation inspection report</h3>\n<p>If you live in a coastal region, you know the damage hurricane winds can do to your home. A <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection</a> tells us how wind-resistant your home is. As you might have guessed, the more fortified your home is, the lower your premiums will be.</p>\n<p>Once a certified inspector checks out your home, they’ll offer a wind mitigation inspection report.

      body: "<p>Kin’s new Responsible Repair discount results in a statewide-average <strong>5% discount</strong> for our <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance policies</a>.</p>\n<p>We created the discount in response to Florida’s assignment of benefits reform (more on that in a bit).</p>\n<p>The important part? You benefit from this discount with Kin if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You live in Florida</li>\n<li>You have a site-built home</li>\n<li>You want to maintain your control during the claims process</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"theinspirationfortheresponsiblerepairdiscount\">The inspiration for the Responsible Repair discount</h2>\n<p>First, a little backstory: <a href=\"/blog/assignment-of-benefits-scams/\">assignment of benefits</a> is when a policyholder signs over their insurance rights to another party (usually a <a href=\"/faq/avoid-contractor-fraud/\">contractor</a>). That might seem like it takes some burden off the homeowner during the claims process, but in practice, it allowed opportunists to inflate claims and sue insurance companies. There's evidence that attorneys were even encouraging these lawsuits and seeking to have the insurance companies pay the attorney fees.</p>\n<p>That cycle was hurting homeowners. The surging cost of inflated claims kept forcing the price of home insurance up so insurers could stay solvent.</p>\n<p>That’s a long way of saying reform was long overdue in Florida, but the state recently passed a law to help reduce insurance fraud and claim inflation – and that’s good news for everyone.</p>\n<p>It means we can offer a policy that <strong>rewards you</strong> if you agree not to hand over your benefits to a contractor or vendor. When you agree to that, we give you our Responsible Repair discount – an acknowledgment that maintaining your control in the <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">claims experience</a> is important and responsible.</p>\n<p>Questions about available discounts?

      body: "<h2 id=\"whatisacentralalarmsystem\">What is a central alarm system?</h2>\n<p>There are usually two alarm systems that qualify you for <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">home insurance discounts</a> from most carriers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A centrally monitored fire alarm</li>\n<li>A centrally monitored burglar alarm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order for a home’s alarm system to be considered centrally monitored, the system <strong>must be monitored off site</strong>.</p>\n<p>Plenty of homes have local fire and smoke alarms. When activated, these set off a siren, strobe, or sound, but they don’t notify authorities. Local systems depend on someone being near enough to hear them to take action.</p>\n<p>By contrast, a centrally monitored system is monitored by an alarm company around the clock. When activated, the company notifies authorities, whether that’s the police for burglary or the fire department for a fire.</p>\n<p>For Kin, only centrally monitored fire and security alarms qualify for discounts. You must provide proof for each system (one for fire and one for burglary) to get both discounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theperksofacentrallymonitoredsecuritysystem\">The perks of a centrally monitored security system</h2>\n<p>Centrally monitored alarm systems tend to qualify for insurance discounts because they are more secure. If a company that monitors your system can respond quickly to a theft or fire, you might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incur less property damage from smoke or fire</li>\n<li>Suffer fewer losses from theft</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whenever you take steps to make your home safer and reduce loss exposures, insurance companies typically reward you with lower premiums. After all, fewer or less severe <a href=\"/claims/\">claims</a> are good for all parties involved.</p>\n<p>But there's also the added benefit of peace of mind. If you're out of town and something happens, the security company can help coordinate damage control. Most centrally monitored systems on the market today also have smartphone apps that alert you when something's awry, giving you <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-lack-security-basics/\">more control over your home's safety</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprovethatyouhaveacentrallymonitoredalarmsystem\">How to prove that you have a centrally monitored alarm system</h2>\n<p>Your monitoring company will typically issue you a <strong>certificate of alarm</strong>. Most even allow you to download the certificate from your customer portal online. This document states what type of alarm(s) you have and how the system is monitored.</p>\n<p>To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site.</p>\n<p>If you only have one centrally monitored system, that’s okay! Submit your certificate so we can get you a discount.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about alarm discounts, feel free to give us a call at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">(855) 717-0022</a>.</p>"

The inspection may also reveal some repairs that need to be made in order for your home to be eligible for insurance.</p>\n<p>We’ve recently adopted home self-inspections – they’re free for our customers and a convenient way to get inspections done without having someone come out to your house.</p>\n<p>Self inspections are due within <strong>7 days</strong> of the policy’s effective date for new home purchases and within <strong>7 days</strong> of signing up for a policy if you already live in your home.

All Florida inspection forms are the same and ask these seven questions (<a href=\"https://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/OIR-B1-1802.pdf\">see a sample form here</a> and snippets of each question below):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Building code:</strong> The first question on all Florida mitigation inspections forms asks whether your home was built in compliance with the Florida Building Code 2001 or later or South Florida Building Code 94.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/wind%20mit%20question%201.png?width=1978&name=wind%20mit%20question%201.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Roof covering:</strong> This question asks about the type of roof coverings your home has – that is, the material your roof is made of: asphalt / fiberglass shingle; concrete / clay / tile; metal; built up; membrane; or other. If your roof has been replaced recently, provide the permit you had for the construction; it’ll help the inspector accurately assess your roof. The inspector will also determine whether your roof coverings are approved by Florida building codes at the time of installation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/wind%20mit%20question%202.png?width=1986&name=wind%20mit%20question%202.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Roof-deck attachment:</strong> This question determines how well your roof deck is secured to the truss/rafter and the strength of the attachment (in most cases, option A is the weakest and C is the strongest). The inspector will even look at the length of the nails that attach the roof sheathing to the roof truss / rafter – the longer the nails (8d are the longest) and the closer they are together (6 inches is preferred), the better.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/wind%20mit%20question%203.png?width=2042&name=wind%20mit%20question%203.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Roof-to-wall attachment:</strong> This indicates how well your roof is attached to the walls of your home. The question offers eight types of connections: (A) toenails, (B) clips, (C) single wraps, (D) double wraps, (E) anchor bolt, (F) other, (G) unknown, and (H) no attic access. Double wraps are considered the strongest type of connection; toenails are considered the weakest.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/wind%20mit%20question%204.png?width=2052&name=wind%20mit%20question%204.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Roof geometry:</strong> This is the shape of your roof and it has a big impact on how well your home withstands strong winds. The inspection form offers three roof shapes: hip roof, flat roof, and other. Hip roofs slope down on all sides and help resist clashes with hurricane winds. For that reason, they tend to get a bigger premium discount.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/wind%20mit%20question%205.png?width=2004&name=wind%20mit%20question%205.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Secondary water resistance:</strong> This part of the inspection determines if your home has a protective layer under the primary layer of the roof (like the shingles). Think of it as that light rain jacket you wear even though you have an umbrella. The inspection form will note whether your roof has SWR or not.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/wind%20mit%20question%206.png?width=1990&name=wind%20mit%20question%206.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Opening protection:</strong> The final part of the wind mitigation inspection form considers “glazed openings” (i.e., openings with windows or glass) and “non-glazed openings” (e.g., entry doors and garage doors) and how impact resistant they are. For instance, they will check for shatterproof windows, bracing on the garage door, hurricane-rated doors, and storm shutters. Without these measures, flying debris can compromise your home's pressure barrier. Consider putting up hurricane shutters before the inspector arrives to make sure you get this credit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/wint%20mit%20question%207.png?width=1982&name=wint%20mit%20question%207.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you decide to make structural changes to your home to qualify for more wind mitigation credits, make sure you work with a licensed engineer and contractor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetthemostinwindmitigationdiscounts\">How to get the most in wind mitigation discounts</h2>\n<p>As you can see above, some wind mitigation components can be added while others (the shape of your roof, for example) are harder to change. That said, these components are generally considered the “safest” for most homes and therefore lead to bigger premium discounts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Roofing materials and installation that meet Florida building codes.</li>\n<li>A roof-deck attachment with plywood / OSB sheathing with a minimum thickness of 7/16 an inch attached to the truss by 8d nails spaced 6 inches apart.</li>\n<li>A roof-wall attachment that uses double wraps (metal connectors that are attached to the wall frame and wrap over the top of the truss).</li>\n<li>A hip roof.</li>\n<li>Secondary water resistance under the roof sheathing,</li>\n<li>Impact-resistant coverings verified for cyclic pressure and large missiles (9 pounds for windows / doors and 4.5 pounds for skylights) over all glass openings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the wind inspection is complete, the inspector will offer suggestions that could improve the sustainability of your property. You can make changes to your property or simply submit your wind mitigation report to your Kin representative.</p>\n<p>You’ll likely receive the most savings if you take the inspector’s suggestions, which will also add to the value of your home – that’s never a bad thing! However, we’re happy to crunch the numbers and see how much you can save based on your inspection report alone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howlongisawindmitigationinspectionvalid\">How long is a wind mitigation inspection valid?</h2>\n<p>Wind mitigation inspections in Florida are valid for <strong>five years</strong>. Put another way, you pay for the inspection, but it saves you money on your home insurance premium every year for five years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoproveyouvehadawindmitigationinspection\">How to prove you’ve had a wind mitigation inspection</h2>\n<p>You can input your report's results when you apply for a Kin quote online or you can provide a copy of your wind mitigation report to your representative. If you think you’ve had one done, you can look over your current policy and see if you received any sort of windstorm mitigation credits. If so, you can ask for a copy of the inspection from your current carrier.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the wind mitigation inspection has to be current. If it’s older than five years old, it’s time for a new one!</p>"
