    body: "<p>A home inventory is a list of all your personal possessions along with their approximate financial value. It can be valuable when you need to <a href=\"/claims/\">file a claim</a> because it helps your insurance company verify your damaged property. That not only helps you get your claim settled faster, but it also minimizes your chances of forgetting to include an item in your claim.</p>\n<p>Some people even inventory their items before they apply for <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>. That way they get a better sense of how much <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property coverage</a> they need.</p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance\">49 percent of homeowners have made a home inventory</a> of their belongings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doineedahomeinventoryforinsurancepurposes\">Do I need a home inventory for insurance purposes?</h2>\n<p>Your insurance company most likely won’t require you to have a home inventory, but it might ask for a sworn proof of loss when you file a claim. “Sworn proof of loss” is an official, notarized sworn statement demonstrating the facts about your loss, the scope of damage, and the value of your personal items that were lost, damaged, or stolen in a way that’s covered by your homeowners policy.</p>\n<p>That can be a lot to deal with, especially if you’re dealing with, say, the aftermath of a hurricane. But if you do a room-by-room home inventory before trouble hits, you have many of the documents you need to support your claim. This typically results in a faster, more accurate claims settlement. Plus, you’ll be able to prove eligibility for tax deductions or disaster assistance.</p>\n<p>Another good reason to take inventory of your belongings is to make sure you get <a href=\"/blog/how-much-personal-property-insurance-do-i-need/\">enough personal property coverage</a>. Listing the value of each individual item presents a clearer picture of how much you’d be out if you suffered a total loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatshouldbeincludedinahomeinventory\">What should be included in a home inventory?</h2>\n<p>A good home inventory should have the following information when it’s available for each item of personal property:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A description, including the make and model</li>\n<li>The estimated value</li>\n<li>Purchase date</li>\n<li>Receipts.</li>\n<li>Serial number</li>\n<li>Purchase contracts and appraisals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember to include off-site items in your home inventory, such as belongings you keep at a storage facility or in a garage. Home insurance policies typically cover those items.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdoiorganizemyhomeinventory\">How do I organize my home inventory?</h2>\n<p>How you organize your home inventory depends on what makes sense for you. Maybe you want to focus on your valuables first. Or perhaps you’d rather go room to room. Whichever way you start, you can use our handy <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/personal-property-inventory-checklist.pdf\">home inventory template and worksheet</a> to keep track.</p>\n<p>Here are some tips for organizing your home inventory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>List high-value items, such as jewelry, artwork, furs, and collectibles. A standard homeowners insurance policy often doesn’t have enough coverage for these items, so you may need <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">scheduled personal property coverage</a> to insure their full value.</li>\n<li>Take pictures of rooms and important individual items.</li>\n<li>Video record your home as you walk through it and describe the contents throughout the house.</li>\n<li>Save an inventory list on your personal computer and keep a copy online. If you’re feeling old school, you can put your photos, inventory list, and video recording in a safety deposit box.</li>\n<li>For ease of reference, organize clothing into categories.</li>\n<li>Don’t give away your only copy. When you file a homeowners insurance claim, don’t give the original inventory or item receipts to anyone, not even your claims adjuster. Make a copy instead.</li>\n<li>Keep your home inventory up to date – remove items you no longer have and add new items as you acquire them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After your inventory is complete, compare the estimated value of your belongings against your insurance coverage. The easiest way to do that is to look at your <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a>. It lists each coverage type with the dollar amount your insurance company pays for that type of claim.</p>\n<p>Your personal property is covered by Coverage C, but it may also be noted on your dec page as coverage limits for “contents.” Whatever it’s called, check the limits. Does it appear to be enough to replace all of your furniture, rugs, curtains, clothes, appliances, and other possessions? If not, call your insurance provider to discuss increasing your limit.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatarethebenefitsofowningahome\">What are the benefits of owning a home?</h2>\n<p>Homeownership is the epitome of the American dream, and your home is likely to be the most significant purchase you’ll ever make. If you purchase wisely, the equity growth of your home could lead to financial security.</p>\n<p>That being said, there are responsibilities that come with owning your own home and it’s not simply a case of replacing your rental check with a mortgage payment. Below we uncover some of the advantages of being a homeowner as well as some other considerations you should be aware of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeownershipbenefits\">Homeownership benefits</h2>\n<h3 id=\"equity\">Equity</h3>\n<p>Paying a mortgage builds equity in your property. Equity is the value you personally own in your home versus that which a bank ‘owns’ due to a mortgage. When you rent a property, your rent goes to the owner and when you leave the property you leave with just your personal belongings. In comparison, when you purchase a property and pay a mortgage, a portion of your monthly payment goes towards paying off the principal debt, thereby increasing your ownership in your property with every payment. The balance of your monthly payment goes to your lender as an interest payment. Should you decide to sell your property you should walk away with increased equity due to the principal you have paid back and, assuming a stable housing market and economy.</p>\n<p>Being a homeowner means you benefit from any improvements you make to enhance the appearance or livability of your property. In turn, this should also increase the value of your property in the long run.</p>\n<h3 id=\"taxbenefits\">Tax benefits</h3>\n<p>Homeowners can benefit from significant <a href=\"/faq/homeownership-tax-benefits/\">tax advantages</a> which potentially makes owning versus renting even more financially viable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stability\">Stability</h3>\n<p>Homeownership can also provide a more stable and independent living environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"importantconsiderationsforfuturehomeowners\">Important considerations for future homeowners</h2>\n<p>Besides your mortgage payment other financial obligations include homeowners association fees (HOA), annual property taxes, homeowners insurance and possibly waste collection fees. All these costs contribute to your monthly expenses. In the case of renting, the homeowner often builds these costs into the rent, so you may find these costs along with your mortgage is not far off what your rental was, but it’s worth being aware of them.</p>\n<p>In addition, maintenance costs and unexpected repairs are something you need to consider and if possible create a separate savings account specifically to cover these costs as the need arise.</p>\n<p>Often first-time homeowners are unaware of the additional costs associated with purchasing a property, other than its purchase price. These ‘hidden’ costs can amount to a healthy sum and include: home inspections, mortgage origination fees and real estate transfer taxes. We recommend discussing these costs with your real estate agent to ensure your savings adequately measures up to the financial commitment you are considering.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, here is nothing quite like the feeling one gets from owning your own home. So if it makes financial sense and the timing is right for you, homeownership can be a highly rewarding decision.</p>"
