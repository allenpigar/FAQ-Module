    body: "<h2 id=\"kininsurancevscitizenspropertyinsurance\">Kin Insurance vs. Citizens property insurance</h2>\n<p>If you’re like most Floridians, especially those with homes near the coast, you’re probably familiar with Citizens Property Insurance Corporation. Established in 2002 by the state government, Citizens is a state-run insurer that offers coverage for those who can’t get <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> on the private market.</p>\n<p>Citizens is a necessary safety net for many homeowners, but it’s important to remember that the state-run provider is an option of last resort for a reason.</p>\n<p>Here are some things to keep in mind if you’re comparing Kin’s coverage to Citizens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understandhowassessmentswork\">Understand how assessments work</h2>\n<p>Because Citizens is a not-for-profit insurer, it puts about 73 percent of every premium dollar toward claims and 17 percent specifically toward paying hurricane claims. Though that leaves a considerable reserve, an intense storm can easily exceed it. When that happens, Citizens is required by Florida law to charge an assessment to cover the remaining damages.</p>\n<p>All Florida policyholders are required to pay an assessment when a widespread disaster strikes and leaves the state-run provider at a deficit. However, Citizens policyholders are charged first and pay the brunt of the additional charges. Citizens policyholders pay up to <strong>45 percent</strong> of their premium. If the shortfall still exists after that, private policyholders will only pay up to 2 percent in assessment charges.</p>\n<p>That’s why, in the words of Citizens, “The true cost of a Citizens policy can increase dramatically following a major disaster.”</p>\n<p>So say you’re looking at a $1,000 Citizens policy versus a $1,000 Kin policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"premiumcomparisonguide\">Premium comparison guide</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Citizens Premium</th>\n<th>Kin Premium</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Total Yearly Premium</td>\n<td>$1,000</td>\n<td>$1,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Potential Assessment Percentage</td>\n<td>45%</td>\n<td>2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Potential Assessment Total</td>\n<td>$450</td>\n<td>$20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>True Policy Cost</td>\n<td>$1,450</td>\n<td>$1,020</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You’d end up paying a lot more for Citizens coverage if you’re assessed.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting this assessment doesn’t include an emergency assessment, a separate charge of up to 30 percent of your premium that can be levied over the course of several years. It applies for all Florida policyholders in an emergency, but again, it means Citizens policyholders bear most of the financial burden to help the state recover after a disaster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"expectadditionalsurcharges\">Expect additional surcharges</h2>\n<p>Some surcharges apply to every home insurance policy sold in Florida. All policyholders pay the $2 <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-fees/\">Emergency Management Preparedness and Assistance Trust Fund</a> (EMPA) fee. Plus, the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Assessment is paid by all insurers to restore the fund if an emergency depletes it.</p>\n<p>But Citizens applies these <a href=\"https://www.citizensfla.com/surcharges\">additional surcharges</a> to its home insurance policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Catastrophe Financing / Reinsurance Surcharge</li>\n<li>Tax-Exempt Surcharge of 1.75 percent</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"someoptionalcoveragesareonlyavailablewithkin\">Some optional coverages are only available with Kin</h2>\n<p>Whereas a Citizens <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a> does offer standard coverages to protect your home, other structures, belongings, loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments, like Kin, it doesn’t allow for as much customization.</p>\n<p>For example, Kin offers these optional coverages (<a href=\"https://www.citizensfla.com/documents/20702/3728641/HO3+Comparison+Form+Citizens+Final.pdf/eaa11755-fa61-427a-afce-d2277effe43a\">Citizens does not</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\">Animal liability protection</a> with no breed restrictions</li>\n<li>Increased replacement cost coverage for your dwelling</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/identity-fraud-insurance/\">Identity theft coverage</a></li>\n<li>Water backup coverage</li>\n<li>Hurricane screen enclosure coverage</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">Scheduled personal property coverage</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about our coverage, give us a call at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>.</p>"

    body: "<p><a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">Condo insurance</a> and homeowners insurance are very similar in that both provide the owner with coverage for the inside of the home, their personal property, as well as protection for personal liability.</p>\n<p>The difference between the two policies is how they handle insuring the structure of the home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ho3vsho6\">HO3 vs. HO6</h2>\n<p>A homeowners insurance policy –&nbsp;or <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a> –&nbsp;covers both the outside and inside structure of the dwelling.</p>\n<p>By contrast, condo insurance –&nbsp;or an <a href=\"/glossary/ho6-policy/\">HO6 policy</a> –&nbsp;usually only covers the inside of the individual unit. In most cases, your condo association's insurance will cover the exterior of the building, common use areas, and the condo building surroundings.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-insurance/\">condo association's master policy</a> can be one of two types – an “all-in” policy which covers the fixtures of your condo, such as carpets and fitted appliances, or a “<a href=\"/glossary/walls-in-insurance/\">bare walls-in</a>” policy, which does not cover anything within the walls of your condo.</p>\n<p>Depending on your condo association's master policy, condo insurance can provide coverage for the following.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingproperty\">Building property</h3>\n<p>Condo policies typically cover for the interior of the property including walls, floors, ceilings and built in furnishings e.g. cabinetry, that are considered for your sole use and not that of other condo owners</p>\n<h3 id=\"personalproperty\">Personal property</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal property insurance</a> covers for your personal belongings inside the condo, including appliances.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whyyouneeddifferentcoverageifyourentyourhouse\">Why you need different coverage if you rent your house</h2>\n<p>As soon as you sign the lease with a tenant, you’ll most likely need to change your homeowners insurance to dwelling property insurance (also called a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>). This type of policy can cover some risks a standard homeowners insurance policy won’t.</p>\n<p>Because you’re not living at the property, your coverage needs to change in two important ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You don’t want to insure all your tenant’s belongings. Renters typically bring stuff with them, so you need a policy that only protects the personal property that belongs to you.</li>\n<li>You need to protect your rental income if there’s a loss. Significant damage to your property may make it uninhabitable, causing you to lose income from rent.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From your insurer’s standpoint, your home may also be more likely to be damaged when you’re not living in the house year round.</p>\n<p>Dwelling property insurance can be easily customized to fit your needs. If you’re renting out property that has appliances and permanent fixtures, it can cover them. And if a covered claim keeps you from renting out the property, a dwelling property policy can include <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">fair rental value coverage</a> to protect your lost income.</p>\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"/faq/dp3-vs-ho3/\">differences between DP3 and HO3 policies</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doeshomeownersinsurancecoverrentalproperties\">Does homeowners insurance cover rental properties?</h2>\n<p>In most cases, standard <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> doesn’t cover rental situations. The logic is simple: your property becomes a business asset when you rent it out, and that creates more risk because tenants typically don’t care for a rented home the way a homeowner does.</p>\n<p>That means if you have a standard HO3 policy on the property and you’re renting it to tenants, you run the risk of not having your losses covered if you need to file a claim.</p>\n<p>While other providers may add an <a href=\"/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> to your policy to cover occasional rentals if the home is primarily your residence, it’s worth noting that isn’t the case with us. Our dwelling property policy can be customized to cover both long-term and short-term rental situations, like Airbnb.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whendoeshomeinsurancecoverrentalproperties\">When does home insurance cover rental properties?</h3>\n<p>Each insurer has its own rules about whether homeowner coverage extends to rentals, so be sure to ask your agent before you buy coverage. In many cases, though, homeowners insurance covers occasional rentals based on the number of people or the length of the stay. For example, renting out a room a few weekends per year may be covered as long as the total number of days rented is less than one month.</p>\n<p>Properties used as long-term rentals or exclusively for short-term rentals almost always require dwelling property insurance that’s not included in a normal homeowner’s policy.</p>\n<p>One caveat to that is our <a href=\"/home-insurance/house-and-property-insurance/\">House & Property insurance</a>. You can customize this policy based on how you use your home, and it’s available in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/south-carolina/\">South Carolina</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/mississippi/\">Mississippi</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/alabama/\">Alabama</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whendoyouneeddwellingpropertyinsurance\">When do you need dwelling property insurance?</h2>\n<p>You may need a dwelling property policy when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don’t reside at the property.</li>\n<li>You rent the property out.</li>\n<li>You use the property for short-term rentals like Airbnb, Vrbo, etc.</li>\n<li>Your home has unique insurance needs (e.g., it has an older roof).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be prepared to let your provider know how long you rent out the home, how much you rent it for, and how the property is used when it’s not being rented. Is it vacant, used as a vacation home, or will you live there? The more details you can provide, the better equipped your policy will be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anoteaboutshorttermrentals\">A note about short-term rentals</h3>\n<p>A lot of people invest in vacation rentals because they think it’s the same as buying a second house. They look at the costs of their residence – their mortgage, insurance, utilities, and other costs – and think the numbers will be similar for short-term rentals. But that’s often not the case.</p>\n<p>The problem is that standard homeowners insurance typically doesn’t cover short-term rentals except in very specific cases. For example, your home insurance may cover a short-term rental if you live at the property and only occasionally rent out a room. But in most cases, you need separate coverage, such as dwelling property coverage.</p>\n<p>Before you rush headlong into investing in short-term rentals, take a look at our article on <a href=\"/blog/airbnb-home-insurance/\">home insurance for Airbnbs</a>, and be sure to check with an agent and make sure you understand the costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"candwellingpropertyinsurancecoverpersonalbelongings\">Can dwelling property insurance cover personal belongings?</h2>\n<p>In some cases, yes, dwelling property insurance can cover personal belongings. But it doesn’t insure your tenants for their belongings in the house – they should have renters insurance (also called an <a href=\"/glossary/ho4-policy/\">HO4 policy</a>) for that.</p>\n<p>Dwelling property insurance policies can cover appliances you provide for your renters in the property lease, like an oven, microwave, refrigerator, and washer and dryer. It’s worth noting that dwelling property insurance doesn’t cover these items for normal wear and tear or damage caused by the tenants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesdwellingpropertyinsurancecost\">How much does dwelling property insurance cost?</h2>\n<p>Dwelling property insurance is usually priced more competitively, thanks to its inclusion of the <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\">roof surfacing payment schedule</a>. This covers the roof for its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value coverage</a> only when it’s damaged by wind or hail. For all other covered sources of damage, the roof and the rest of the home’s structure are insured for their <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>.

    body: "<h2 id=\"doineedhomeownersinsurance\">Do I need homeowners insurance?</h2>\n<p>Essentially, <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> offers protection for your home, other structures on your property and personal possessions, should you suffer damage from a covered loss. It is applicable if the property you are insuring is one that you personally live in. If you choose to rent your property, landlord insurance is better suited to providing you with the relevant protection required for a rental property.</p>\n<p>From a legal perspective you <em>can</em> own a home without homeowners insurance. However, if you finance your home with a mortgage, it is highly likely your lender will require you to have home insurance to protect your home in the unfortunate situation that damage or loss occurs due to a covered peril, like a fire. Should you live in an area prone to natural disasters, such as floods or earthquakes, your lender may also insist that you protect your home with <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> or earthquake coverage.</p>\n<p>If your home is a condo, you should consider taking out condo insurance. Most condo or Homeowner’s Associations require you to take homeowners insurance as the Association’s policies typically do not protect the inside of the condo but only the actual building structure of the condo complex.</p>\n<p>You may also be required by your lender or Homeowner’s Association to purchase a homeowner insurance policy if you live in an area that has above average risk of particular hazards, for example earthquakes or severe winds.</p>\n<p>However, even if purchasing home insurance cover is optional for you, it is something you should seriously consider as it is the smartest way to protect the significant investment you have made in your home. Such protection gives you peace of mind knowing that you will have financial assistance should the need arise. Without homeowners insurance, should disaster strike you could suffer significant financial loss – potentially for many years after the event.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"dp1vsdp3inanutshell\">DP1 vs. DP3 in a nutshell</h2>\n<p>Both DP1 and DP3 policies can be used to cover homes used as primary residences or as investment properties. The key differences between these policies are the types of coverage offered, the number of perils covered, and how they settle claims.</p>\n<p>DP1 only protects against nine perils and usually covers the whole house for its actual cash value, meaning all claims payouts deduct depreciation.</p>\n<p>For comparison, <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3</a> is an open perils policy, which means the home is covered for all sources of loss except those the policy names as exclusions. It primarily covers your dwelling for its <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>, or what it would cost to rebuild your home from the ground up with similar materials after a total loss.</p>\n<p>However, our DP3 policies include the <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\">Roof Surfacing Payment Schedule endorsement</a>, which covers the roof for its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> only when it’s damaged by wind or hail. For all other covered sources of damage, the roof and the rest of the home’s structure are insured for their replacement cost. This adjustment usually means we can insure homes with older roofs and offer a sizable premium discount.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the difference between DP1 and DP3 to get a better understanding of what each policy covers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dp3vsdp1coveragecomparison\">DP3 vs. DP1 coverage comparison</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>DP3</th>\n<th>DP1</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Coverage A (Dwelling)</td>\n<td>Replacement cost</td>\n<td>Actual cash value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Perils Covered</td>\n<td>All perils except those the policy lists as exclusions</td>\n<td>9 named perils</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fair Rental Value</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n<td>No coverage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Personal Liability</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Freezing Pipes</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n<td>No coverage</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"dp1policydetails\">DP1 policy details</h2>\n<p>A DP1, also known as a Dwelling Fire Form 1 policy, is an insurance policy that essentially offers building-only protection. It covers damage caused by the <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> named in the policy, and those perils are usually limited to these nine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire and lightning</li>\n<li>Internal and external explosions</li>\n<li>Windstorm</li>\n<li>Hail</li>\n<li>Riots</li>\n<li>Smoke</li>\n<li>Aircrafts</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>Volcanic explosions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, if your property experienced damage from an incident not listed here, it wouldn’t be covered. That can leave your property vulnerable to some pretty common instances. For example, DP1 doesn’t typically cover vandalism. Moreover, DP1 doesn’t cover your personal property or liability, but you can add those coverage for an extra cost.</p>\n<p>When you make a claim on a DP1 policy, be prepared for a settlement based on the <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> of the loss. This means you’ll receive the payout for the damage minus <a href=\"/glossary/depreciation/\">depreciation</a>.</p>\n<p>Insurers may often use a calculation like this to figure that out:</p>\n<p>R × (E - C) / E = ACV</p>\n<p>In the equation, R is the replacement cost of the item; E is its expected life span; C is the item’s current life; and ACV is actual cash value, or how much you may receive in a claim.</p>\n<p>Say, for example, your roof is damaged by a fire. The roof is 10 years old, and the repairs cost $8,000. A replacement cost policy might pay out that full $8,000, but an actual cash value policy takes into account the useful years left in your roof and its depreciation. So if your roof has an expected life of 20 years, your actual cash value payout comes to:</p>\n<p>$8,000 x (20-10) / 20 = <strong>$4,000</strong></p>\n<p>Another important thing to note about a DP1 policy is that it doesn’t usually cover the loss of rental income. That’s important to know if you’re insuring an investment property because it means you aren’t covered for any rent you may have collected when roof repairs make it impossible for tenants to live there.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, the DP1 is considered a bare-bones property policy for investors and landlords. It’s the least expensive type of dwelling property insurance you can get.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dp3policydetails\">DP3 policy details</h2>\n<p>DP3, also known as a Dwelling Fire Form 3 policy, offers more robust coverage than a DP1. It’s an open perils policy, which means it covers far more types of loss than DP1. Rather than listing a few covered perils, the DP3 covers all perils except those listed in the policy as exclusions. That means your property gets much, much more protection.</p>\n<p>Some common DP3 exclusions are loss or damage from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ordinance or law.</li>\n<li>Earth movement.</li>\n<li>Flood damage.</li>\n<li>Power failure.</li>\n<li>Neglect.</li>\n<li>War.</li>\n<li>Nuclear hazard.</li>\n<li>Intentional loss.</li>\n<li>Governmental action.</li>\n<li>Mold.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The DP3 policy also differs from DP1 in how it pays for losses. While DP1 factors depreciation into claims payouts, DP3 typically pays based on the home’s replacement value. As noted earlier, our DP3 policies do factor in the roof’s depreciation for wind or hail claims only. This adjustment means even homes with older roofs are eligible for coverage and helps keep costs low.</p>\n<p>DP3 is considered the most robust of the three dwelling property insurance policies because it can also cover other structures, personal property, loss of use or <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">fair rental value</a> (depending on how you use the property), liability, and medical payments.</p>\n<p>Fair rental value is a particularly important coverage for investment properties. It can cover lost rental income when the property is uninhabitable after a covered loss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoyouneedadp1vsadp3\">When do you need a DP1 vs. a DP3?</h2>\n<p>Typically, a DP1 policy is used for vacant properties (and properties that will be vacant for at least 30 days). These might be properties pending a sale or assumed in probate that don’t have the need for robust coverage. Investors who plan on rehabbing a property to flip might also get a DP1 policy.</p>\n<p>However, if the property owner needs expanded or more customizable coverage, DP3 is usually the better policy. You might consider a DP3 policy if you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A roof that is 10 years old or older.</li>\n<li>An investment property and need to protect your rental income.</li>\n<li>Personal belongings on the property.</li>\n<li>Concerns about the excluded perils in a DP1 policy, such as vandalism.</li>\n<li>Exposure to liability claims for bodily harm and property damage on your premises.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A DP1 policy usually isn’t the best option for a property with tenants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetadwellingpropertyinsurancequote\">How to get a dwelling property insurance quote</h2>\n<p>Let our team help you find the dwelling property insurance that fits your needs and protects your home.

    body: "<p>Both DP3 and HO3 can cover your dwelling and other structures on your property. However, a DP3 can cover some risks an HO3 policy can’t.</p>\n<p>Much like an <a href=\"/glossary/ho3-policy/\">HO3 policy</a>, a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>, also called dwelling property insurance, covers your home and other structures on your property. But these policies have some important differences that make them more appropriate for certain situations. Let’s take a look at each option in more detail and see how they compare.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dp3vsho3howthecoveragescompare\">DP3 vs. HO3: How the coverages compare</h2>\n<p>At first glance, you’ll see more similarities than differences between the DP3 and HO3. Both are designed to cover homes and other structures on an open perils basis. That means the structures are protected for all sources of damage except the few the policy lists as exclusions.</p>\n<p>Both policies can also offer the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage A, or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> for the structure of your home.</li>\n<li>Coverage B, or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">coverage for other structures</a> on the property.</li>\n<li>Coverage C, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal property insruance</a> for your belongings.</li>\n<li>Coverage D, or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a> if your home's made uninhabitable.</li>\n<li>Coverage E, or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability insurance</a>.</li>\n<li>Coverage F, or <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">medical payments coverage</a> for injured guests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some coverages come standard with the HO3 that you can add on to the DP3, and the DP3 can cover some risks an HO3 can’t. The chart below shows how that works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dp3vsho3coveragedetails\">DP3 vs. HO3: Coverage details</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>DP3</th>\n<th>HO3</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Coverage A (Dwelling)</td>\n<td>Open perils</td>\n<td>Open perils</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Coverage B (Other Structures)</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Coverage C (Personal Property</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Coverage D (Loss of Use)</td>\n<td>Loss of use &amp; loss of rent covered</td>\n<td>Loss of use covered</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Coverage E (Personal Liability)</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Coverage F (Medical Payments)</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Roof Surfacing Payment Schedule</td>\n<td>Included</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You’ll notice the biggest difference in DP3 vs. HO3 is that some coverages are added by default and others are optional.</p>\n<p>The second biggest difference is DP3’s inclusion of the <a href=\"/faq/roof-surfacing-payment-schedule/\">Roof Surfacing Payment Schedule</a> endorsement, which covers the roof for its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value coverage</a> only when it’s damaged by wind or hail. For all other covered sources of damage, the roof and the rest of the home’s structure are insured for their <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. This endorsement comes with a sizable premium discount.</p>\n<p>Coverage D is also interesting in the case of DP3. If the home you’re insuring is a rental property, then Coverage D can have <a href=\"/glossary/fair-rental-value/\">fair rental value coverage</a> to make up for lost rent when a covered claim makes it uninhabitable. Coverage D in an HO3 policy usually only covers additional living expenses when a covered claim keeps you from living in a home that is your primary residence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedsadp3vsho3\">Who needs a DP3 vs. HO3?</h2>\n<p>So now that you know the similarities and differences between DP3 and HO3, how do you know which is right for you?</p>\n<p>The answer really depends on your situation.</p>\n<p>The DP3 policy is often a good option for homeowners with unique coverage needs. For example, it can be tricky to find insurance if you rent out your home on Airbnb, but a DP3 can often cover that use. And because of the Roof Surfacing Payment Schedule endorsement, homes with older roofs are also usually a good fit for a DP3. This makes the premium more affordable and eliminates the need to find coverage through a state-run program.</p>\n<p>These are usually the most common reasons for choosing a DP3 policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You inherited the property and it’s sitting vacant while you work on selling it.</li>\n<li>You’ve moved out of a home you’re selling, and you need it insured in the meantime.</li>\n<li>You own an investment property that you rent out short or long term.</li>\n<li>Your home has a roof that’s 10 years or older.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An HO3 policy is a good balance of coverage and affordability to protect your primary residence. You might opt for this policy if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You live in the home year round.</li>\n<li>You don’t rent out your home.</li>\n<li>Your roof is brand new.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you need help figuring out which policy makes sense for your needs, just <a href=\"/contact/\">give us a call</a>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettingadp3vsho3quote\">Getting a DP3 vs. HO3 quote</h2>\n<p>Whether you want an HO3 or DP3 policy, getting a quote is as easy as entering your address and answering a few quick questions about your property.

Maybe you even have a few quotes.

How can you tell whether your quote offers too much coverage or not enough?</p>\n<p>Aside from working with Kin (we tailor your coverage to fit your home – not too much or too little), this guide will help you figure out how much coverage you may need. We’ll take a look at each part of the policy: dwelling, other structures, personal property, loss of use, liability, and medical payments. And if you’re rusty on what those are, we’ll refresh your memory on that, too.</p>\n<p>Let’s do this.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Choosing Your Coverage Limits</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type of Coverage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dwelling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other Structures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Personal Property</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Loss of Use</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Personal Liability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medical Payments</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchhomeownersinsurancedoineedformydwelling\">How much homeowners insurance do I need for my dwelling?</h2>\n<p>Look at <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">coverage A</a> on your quote or on your policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/declarations-page/\">declarations page</a>. This is the amount you’ll have to rebuild or repair your home after a covered event. Your home should be insured up to its full <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a> – that is, what it would cost to rebuild your home from the ground up after a total loss. Anything less than 100 percent replacement cost coverage means you aren’t fully insured.</p>\n<p>We calculate your home’s replacement based on its square footage, construction materials, local construction costs, and other factors, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exterior wall construction (frame, veneer, or masonry)</li>\n<li>Style of house</li>\n<li>Number of rooms</li>\n<li>Number of bathrooms</li>\n<li>Roof type</li>\n<li>Special features, like fireplaces or arched windows</li>\n<li>Foundation shape</li>\n<li>Improvements you made</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can roughly calculate your home’s replacement cost on your own by taking your home’s square footage and multiplying it by local building costs per square foot.</p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/buyer-how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-house/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202017%20Construction,total%20average%20cost%20is%20%24427%2C893.\">national average cost </a>to build a home is $154 per square foot, so a 2,000 square foot home may cost about $308,000 to rebuild. But that’s the national average – your local building and labor costs may be higher or lower.</p>\n<p>Remember, not all policies are created equal. Dwelling coverage can be offered on an <a href=\"/blog/replacement-cost-vs-acv/\">actual cash value or replacement cost</a> basis, and it makes a big difference in your claims payout. <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">Actual cash value</a> policies are cheaper, but they only cover the depreciated value of your home. It’s often not enough coverage to actually fully rebuild after a major loss.</p>\n<p>Replacement cost policies, like the ones offered by Kin, pay for what it costs to rebuild your home entirely at the current market rate. After a total loss, your home can be rebuilt to its former glory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingcodeupgrades\">Building code upgrades</h3>\n<p>If you have to rebuild your home to comply with new (and more expensive) building codes, your policy’s <a href=\"/glossary/law-ordinance-coverage/\">ordinance of law</a> coverage may come in handy. For example, say you rebuild your $308,000 home, but you need an extra $10,000 to update its electrical panel to comply with a new code. Ordinance of law coverage can pay for that.</p>\n<p>This is usually set at 10 percent of your dwelling coverage. So if your home is insured for $308,000, that would be $30,800 in ordinance or law coverage.</p>\n<p>If you have an older home, it may make sense to increase your ordinance or law coverage to 20 percent in case your systems are outdated or your building codes aren’t up to date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchhomeownersinsurancedoineedforotherstructures\">How much homeowners insurance do I need for other structures?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a> pays for damage to other structures on your property, like fences, garages, sheds, carports, etc. You usually want to insure other structures at 20 percent of your dwelling coverage.</p>\n<p>But if you have elaborate other structures on your property, like a fully furnished guest studio with a kitchen and bathroom, it might make sense to increase this coverage.

That includes your appliances, furniture, electronics, decor, clothing, and more.</p>\n<p>At minimum, coverage C should be 20 percent of your dwelling coverage. So if your home is insured for $308,000, you should have at least $61,600 for your personal property.

List out the major items and include receipts for big purchases like furniture or electronics. Our <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/personal-property-inventory-checklist.pdf\">home inventory guide</a> walks you through how to do it.</p>\n<p>Once you have the total value of your personal belongings, you’ll know the exact amount of coverage you need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchlossofuseinsurancedoineed\">How much loss of use insurance do I need?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Coverage D</a>, loss of use coverage, steps in when a claim forces you to live away from your home while repairs are underway. It offers an allowance for extra living expenses during this time, like transportation, takeout, laundry, hotel stays, and more.</p>\n<p>Loss of use coverage should be 20 percent of your home’s dwelling coverage. Again, for a $308,000 home, that would be $61,600 in loss of use protection.

So if your tree falls on a neighbor's roof or your kid hits a home run through someone’s window, this can help pay for those expenses.</p>\n<p>Every homeowner should have at least $100,000 in personal liability coverage, enough to cover common claims.

    body: "<h2 id=\"replacementcostvsmarketvalue\">Replacement cost vs market value</h2>\n<p>The cost to rebuild your home after a disaster may not be the same price you paid for your home (i.e., its market value). It might not be the same as your mortgage insurance requirements, either.</p>\n<p>It’s a pretty common misconception that a home's <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a> should be the same as its market value – and that might explain why <a href=\"https://www.corelogic.com/products/residential-cost-handbook.aspx\">64 percent of homes are underinsured by an average of 27 percent</a>.</p>\n<p>So let’s set the record straight. Here’s your guide to why your rebuild cost may be higher (or lower) than your home’s market value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rebuildcostvsmarketvaluewhatthesetermsmean\">Rebuild cost vs market value: What these terms mean</h2>\n<p>Your homeowners insurance replacement cost is what it would cost to rebuild your home from the ground up with similar materials after a covered disaster. It also accounts for current labor costs. This total cost may be higher or lower than what you paid for your home and what it might sell for – more on that in a minute.</p>\n<p>Your home’s market value refers to the amount your home might sell for. That price may be higher or lower than what you paid for your home, depending on market conditions. This number factors in your home, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">additional structures</a>, and the land on which it is built. Your land is valuable, but it's usually not at serious risk of loss, so a standard home insurance policy doesn't account for it. (The exception may be <a href=\"/glossary/sinkhole-insurance/\">sinkhole insurance</a>.)</p>\n<p>The market value also includes intangible factors that influence the price of your home: its location, neighborhood, proximity to good schools, and commutability to work locations. These can increase or decrease the value of your home when you sell it, but they don't impact how much it should cost to cover your home against damage.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at situations when these two figures may not match.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenmarketvalueandreplacementcostmaybedifferent\">When market value and replacement cost may be different</h2>\n<p>The cost to rebuild your home may be more than the market value or purchase price, depending on when you purchased the home, current property values, inflation, and other factors. That's because it can cost more to rebuild a home from scratch, especially after a local disaster that may drive up labor and material costs.</p>\n<p>As economic recessions in the past have demonstrated, it’s possible for the cost of raw materials and fuel to rise even as property values fall. Global economic conditions can also impact domestic construction prices. Even if the US is in a housing slump and construction is at a standstill, construction may be booming in other countries and drive up the cost of materials.</p>\n<p>Although the replacement cost of a home and its market value are usually close during good economic conditions, don’t be alarmed if your replacement cost is slightly higher than your home purchase price, especially if you bought your home a while ago. Replacement costs <em>should</em> reflect the current market – otherwise you wouldn’t have enough coverage to pay for a full rebuild after a catastrophe.</p>\n<p>Dealing with the aftermath of a catastrophic event is difficult enough without worrying about the cost of rebuilding your home. That’s why a good provider will make sure your home and additional structures are insured accurately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchshouldyouinsureyourhousefor\">How much should you insure your house for?</h2>\n<p>Your home should have enough replacement cost coverage to account for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local construction costs</li>\n<li>The structure’s total square footage (not including the land)</li>\n<li>The home’s exterior construction (e.g., frame, masonry, or veneer)</li>\n<li>The home’s style (e.g., Cape Cod, ranch, contemporary, or Victorian)</li>\n<li>Total bathrooms and rooms</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">Roof type</a> and materials</li>\n<li>Renovations to the home and unique features (e.g., arched doorways and fireplaces)</li>\n<li>Other structures, such as garages, greenhouses, fences, and sheds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you work with a company like Kin, we will calculate your home’s replacement cost based on these factors for you. But to give yourself a very rough estimate that doesn’t account for all these variables, you can multiply the square footage of your home by your local per-square-foot building costs.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you have an <a href=\"/glossary/ho8-policy/\">older home</a>, know that a replacement cost policy may not be the best option. That’s because it may not be possible to rebuild it using similar materials – those materials may no longer be available. In these cases, a modified insurance policy may be the appropriate option – it allows for repairs or replacements using modern construction materials. If you want to insure a property that may fall into this category, it’s worth discussing the replacement conditions with your provider.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatisaroofsurfacingpaymentschedule\">What is a roof surfacing payment schedule?</h2>\n<p>Most insurance companies either refuse to insure homes with older roofs or price the policy so high that it's cost prohibitive.</p>\n<p>The roof surfacing payment schedule provides these homeowners with coverage at a more affordable price. And it allows homeowners to replace their roof when  necessary rather than when it reaches an inflexible age cut-off.</p>\n<p>A roof surfacing payment schedule is an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> that modifies how your roof is insured. Without this endorsement, a roof is typically covered for its <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a> – that is, how much it would cost to completely replace the roof with similar materials at today’s market rate.</p>\n<p>Once the roof payment schedule is attached to your policy, it lowers your premium significantly and covers the roof surface for its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> – a fancy insurance term that means the roof’s <a href=\"/glossary/depreciation/\">depreciation</a> is factored into your payout for wind or hail damage to the roof. Roof depreciation is based on its age and surface materials.</p>\n<p>In this case, a roof surface can mean its shingles, tiles, underlayment, felt, membranes, vents, drip edges, turbines, skylights, or other roofing components.</p>\n<p>The nice thing about this endorsement is that homes with older roofs can actually get insured instead of being turned away or forced to go to state-run insurance programs for coverage. And if you have a new roof, the depreciation deduction is very little, but you still save money on your home insurance premium.</p>\n<p>This endorsement only applies to roof surfaces for wind and hail damage. Other damage to the home is paid on a replacement-cost basis as usual.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whoneedstheroofsurfacingpaymentschedule\">Who needs the roof surfacing payment schedule?</h2>\n<p>The roof surface payment schedule is designed to make a <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> policy more affordable for homes with older roofs. But anyone who wants to save more on their premium would be a good fit for this add-on.</p>\n<p>This endorsement may apply for homes with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shingle roofs more than 10 years old.</li>\n<li>Metal roofs more than 10 years old.</li>\n<li>Tile roofs more than 10 years old.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatarethebenefitsofaroofsurfacingpaymentschedule\">What are the benefits of a roof surfacing payment schedule?</h2>\n<p>The biggest benefit of this type of coverage is that it lowers your premium in exchange for a lower amount of roof coverage – but only for wind and hail damage. In short, the older your roof, the bigger your discount.</p>\n<p>It’s also useful if you don’t want to pay for a brand-new <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">roof</a> in order to get insured to meet your mortgage requirements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howisdepreciationcalculatedforaroofpaymentschedule\">How is depreciation calculated for a roof payment schedule?</h2>\n<p>Roof claims for wind or hail damage are paid out on a depreciated value based on the roof’s materials and age. The depreciated value is calculated by subtracting the roof’s depreciation from its replacement cost.</p>\n<p>This is the depreciation schedule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metal reaches maximum depreciation of 30 percent at 30 years (1 percent a year).</li>\n<li>Tile reaches maximum depreciation of 60 percent at 30 years (2 percent a year).</li>\n<li>Shingle reaches maximum depreciation of 75 percent at 19 years (4 percent a year).</li>\n<li>Between 0 years and the years listed above, it depreciates linearly annually.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So say your shingle roof is heavily damaged during a windstorm, and it would cost $15,000 to replace it. Now let’s say your roof is 12 years old.</p>\n<p>According to the schedule, your roof has depreciated by 48 percent (4 percent times 12 years = 48 percent). That puts a potential payout for this claim at $7,800: $15,000 (replacement cost) minus $7,200 (depreciation) = $7,800.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>{{<  rsps-chart >}}</p>\n<p>We'd like to emphasize that this chart represents depreciation, not eligibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whendoestheroofsurfacingpaymentscheduleapply\">When does the roof surfacing payment schedule apply?</h2>\n<p>The roof surfacing payment schedule only applies to roof damage caused by wind and hail events. That includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windstorms.</li>\n<li>Hail storms.</li>\n<li>Sleet.</li>\n<li>Hurricanes.</li>\n<li>Tornadoes.</li>\n<li>Derechos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if the roof is damaged by another event, like fire, the roof surfacing payment schedule wouldn't apply.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doestheroofsurfacingpaymentscheduleaffecttherestofmyhome\">Does the roof surfacing payment schedule affect the rest of my home?</h2>\n<p>No, even with this schedule, the rest of your home is still insured up to its coverage limits. So say a hurricane tears a hole in your roof and damages the sides of your home and windows. Damage to the roof would be paid out in full minus the roof’s depreciation. The rest of the damage would be paid at what it costs to rebuild without subtracting depreciation if you have replacement cost coverage.</p>"

The best way to do that – and prevent claims – is to maintain your solar panels by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Regular cleaning.</strong> Clean your panels to remove dust, debris, and bird droppings. Most dust can be removed by spraying the panels with a garden hose. For caked-on grime or droppings, you may need to wipe it down with a rag and water.</li>\n<li><strong>Clearing overhanging branches.</strong> You don’t want trees to obstruct the panel and hinder its ability to absorb sunlight. Not only will the shade make your system less efficient, but it makes it more likely that a branch could fall and damage your panels.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspecting your solar panels each year.</strong> Make sure your panels are properly attached to your roof – no loose screws or movement. Look for rodents or nests.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"howtofileasolarpanelclaim\">How to file a solar panel claim</h2>\n<p>If you have a solar panel loss, call us right away or <a href=\"/claims/\">submit your claim online</a>.</p>\n<p>You’ll typically want to document the damage with photos as best as you can. We’ll also ask that you do your part to mitigate further losses. For example, if a panel was torn off and you have a hole in your roof, you might need to cover the hole to prevent water from entering the home and compounding the damage.</p>\n<p>Make sure you also have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The date and time of loss.</li>\n<li>A description of the circumstances that caused the damage.</li>\n<li>A copy of your purchase agreement. Remember that only panels you own are covered.</li>\n</ul>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"cankininsuremyhomeifitsownedbyatrust\">Can Kin insure my home if it’s owned by a trust?</h2>\n<p>Yes, Kin offers coverage for homes that are owned by a trust. And that’s notable considering most insurers either don’t insure these homes or limit the coverage enough that it can leave homeowners underprotected.</p>\n<p>There’s no industry-standard approach to insuring trust-owned properties, so our take was simple: find the solution that benefits homeowners in this unique situation the most. We determined adding the trust as an additional insured is the way to go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisatrust\">What is a trust?</h2>\n<p>A trust is an arrangement usually used to minimize estate taxes. It allows a third party (the trustee) to hold assets, such as property, on behalf of beneficiaries. Homes are often held in trusts to keep the property from entering probate, which can be a long and drawn-out legal process to settle a deceased person’s estate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howkininsurestrustownedhomes\">How Kin insures trust-owned homes</h2>\n<p>Our approach to covering trust-owned homes is a little different. With Kin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Residents of the property are the named insureds on the <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a>.</li>\n<li>Trusts are added as an additional insured.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, residents and the trust get the full benefits of the policy – including <strong>worldwide liability coverage.</strong> That means you and your family have coverage for bodily injury and property damage accidentally caused to others no matter where the incident happens.</p>\n<p>That’s a significant benefit of our coverage compared to other providers. When insurers do offer liability coverage for trust-owned homes, they often limit this essential protection or exclude it altogether.</p>\n<h2 id=\"potentialgapsinhowothersinsuretrustownedhomes\">Potential gaps in how others insure trust-owned homes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\"><strong>Liability Coverage</strong></a></p>\n<p>If an insurer lists the trust as the named insured, the trust typically has coverage for the dwelling, other structures, personal property, and personal liability. However, occupants of the home typically wouldn’t get liability protection because trusts are a legal entity – they don’t have spouses, children, or relatives. That means if your child accidentally hits a baseball through your neighbor’s window, you’d be responsible for paying those damages out of pocket because only the trust has liability coverage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\"><strong>Personal Property Coverage</strong></a></p>\n<p>If the trust is the named insured and not the residents, then personal property is typically only covered while located at the home. That means if you lose your luggage while traveling, you wouldn’t have coverage to replace it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wevegottrustownedhomescovered\">We’ve got trust-owned homes covered</h2>\n<p>We want to make sure the people who live in the home get the appropriate protection for their belongings and activities. That’s why we write trust-owned homes the way we do.</p>\n<p>Questions about insuring your home? Give us a call at <a href=\"tel:855-717-0022\">855-717-0022</a>.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"howareplacementcostestimateworks\">How a replacement cost estimate works</h2>\n<p>The most important reason for getting <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance</a> is to make sure you can replace your home if you have a total loss. You don’t want to come up short if you need to rebuild your entire house, so it’s critical that you understand how a replacement cost estimate (RCE) works.</p>\n<p>Your dwelling coverage limits should cover your home’s <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. This is the amount that you pay to rebuild your home from the ground up using materials of a similar quality. Many people choose to insure the structure of their home for its entire replacement cost, as opposed to its <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a>, because it’s the option most likely to make them whole after a total loss.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies use the information you put on your application, proprietary formulas, and third-party data to calculate your home’s replacement cost estimate. However, inflation can cause construction costs to fluctuate, and that can change your replacement costs. This means <a href=\"/glossary/insurer/\">insurers</a> make adjustments to your replacement cost estimate to make sure you have the appropriate amount of coverage.</p>\n<p>Worth noting: your home’s <a href=\"/faq/replacement-cost-and-home-price/\">replacement cost estimate and market value are different</a>. The market value is what someone will pay for your home, not what it costs to build it. So depending on market conditions, the replacement cost could be more or less than your home’s market value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatfactorsintoareplacementcostestimate\">What factors into a replacement cost estimate?</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies use many factors to estimate the rebuild cost of your home. The replacement cost estimate focuses namely on the size of your home and the quality of the materials and appliances. For example, your insurer may look at the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of corners on the house.</li>\n<li>Roof type.</li>\n<li>Type of exterior walls (siding, masonry, wood).</li>\n<li>Size of the home.</li>\n<li>Floor type (carpet, tile, hardwood, laminate).</li>\n<li>Cabinet type.</li>\n<li>Type of countertops.</li>\n<li>Number of bathrooms.</li>\n<li>Tub type (standard, jacuzzi).</li>\n<li>Special features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But other costs also factor into a replacement cost estimate, like paying for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skilled labor.</li>\n<li>Designers and architects.</li>\n<li>Demolition and debris removal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our system automatically crunches these numbers for you and accounts for building and material costs in your area to calculate your estimate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howconstructioncostsimpactreplacementcostestimates\">How construction costs impact replacement cost estimates</h3>\n<p>While the materials and structure of your home are only going to change if you do a major renovation, construction costs vary based on market conditions. And as construction costs go up, so does your replacement cost estimate.</p>\n<p>In 2021, data analytics company Verisk reported that reconstruction took a sharp upward trend, driven in part by <a href=\"/blog/lumber-prices-2021/\">skyrocketing lumber prices</a>.The company reports that soaring gas prices and overall inflation are having much the <a href=\"https://www.verisk.com/siteassets/media/underwriting-v/resources/360value-quarterly/360value-q2-2022-usa-report.pdf\">same effect in 2022</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtocalculateyourreplacementcostestimate\">How to calculate your replacement cost estimate</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies use a replacement cost estimator tool to figure out your replacement cost, you can estimate it on your own.</p>\n<p>Start with the <a href=\"/blog/how-to-calculate-square-footage-of-a-house/\">square footage of your house</a> and multiply that by the average building costs in your area. For example, let’s say your home is 1,800 square feet, and building costs are $185 per square foot. That means your replacement cost estimate is $333,000, as shown below:</p>\n<p><strong>1,800 square feet x $185 per square foot = $333,000</strong></p>\n<p>Remember, this is just an estimate, not the actual cost. If you want a more accurate estimate, then you may want to talk to a contractor who can better evaluate your home’s design and building materials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howhomeownerscanprepareforrisingreplacementcostestimates\">How homeowners can prepare for rising replacement cost estimates</h2>\n<p>If your replacement cost estimate increases – and considering the direction construction costs are going, it probably will – then you should be ready for a bump in your homeowners insurance premium. Basically, your insurance provider will recommend increasing your limits so you’re ready for a disaster. As your dwelling coverage increases, so does your premium.</p>\n<p>Increases to your premium usually take place at <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-renewal/\">renewal</a>, a process that begins a few months before your expiration date. During renewal, you can see how your previous dwelling coverage compares with the new replacement cost estimate.</p>\n<p>You may want to revisit your policy’s replacement cost estimate if you’ve remodeled or renovated any part of your home. Just taking something like plywood cabinets and replacing them with custom cabinets can increase your replacement cost. If you don’t let your insurer know so they can update your policy to reflect that change, you may not have adequate coverage for your upgrades.</p>"
