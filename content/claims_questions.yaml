In addition to causing billions in damage, natural disasters may subject homeowners to opportunists hoping to take advantage of confusing and turbulent times.</p>\n<p>Contractor fraud is rampant following a natural catastrophe. Though some states have <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-insurance-fraud\">passed laws aimed to protect homeowners</a> from contractor fraud, such as prohibiting rebates and allowing for contract termination, the fact remains that homeowners must be vigilant to avoid potential scams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcontractorfraudlookslike\">What contractor fraud looks like</h2>\n<p>Not every professional who goes door-to-door offering to clean up or make repairs after a catastrophe is out to scam you. However, this is a common tactic by folks who might try to defraud victims after a major, community-wide disaster.</p>\n<p>Fraudulent service providers may try to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get upfront payment for a job and never show up for it.</li>\n<li>Begin a job but not complete it.</li>\n<li>Use subpar materials or deliver shoddy work to pocket more profit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to contact your insurance company before you begin any construction or repair work on your home following a disaster. They can guide you on next steps and make sure you work with trusted contractors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"assignmentofbenefitscamsinflorida\">Assignment of benefit scams in Florida</h3>\n<p>One of the most common forms of contractor fraud in Florida is an <a href=\"/blog/assignment-of-benefits-scams/\">assignment of benefit</a> (AOB) scam. In this scam, a homeowner signs a document assigning benefits from an insurance policy to a contractor. This allows the contractor to deal directly with the homeowner’s insurance company to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File claims.</li>\n<li>Make repair decisions.</li>\n<li>Receive claim payouts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Essentially, signing an AOB may mean an unscrupulous contractor can claim benefits for work that was never actually completed.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, AOB scams have gotten a lot of attention and <a href=\"https://www.myfloridacfo.com/division/ica/2022propertyinsurancechanges\">Florida’s Senate Bill 2A</a> has taken aim at the problem in an effort to reduce the scam’s frequency and effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipstoavoidpostdisastercontractorfraud\">Tips to avoid post-disaster contractor fraud</h2>\n<p>In addition to calling your insurance company before you hire a contractor, as a general rule, if you didn’t request the work, don’t accept it.</p>\n<p>These pointers can help you find a reputable contractor when you are ready to get repairs on your home underway.</p>\n<p><strong>DO:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get more than one estimate so you can compare rates and timelines.</li>\n<li>Get all promised work in writing, including all repairs, cost, timeline, payment schedules, and work warranties.</li>\n<li>Ask for references, read reviews of the contractor’s work, and look up their business on the Better Business Bureau or Angie’s List.</li>\n<li>Check the contractor’s driver’s license and write down their license number.</li>\n<li>Ask for the contractor’s insurance certificate and licensing.</li>\n<li>Review all documents sent from the contractor to your insurance provider.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>DON’T:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign an incomplete contract or a work order with blanks.</li>\n<li>Pay a contractor in full before work is finished.</li>\n<li>Sign a completion certificate before the work is complete and inspected for code compliance.</li>\n<li>Hire a contractor because they pressured you.</li>\n<li>Let a contractor decide what your policy covers.</li>\n<li>Let a contractor dissuade you from talking to your insurer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whyhomeownersneedtoavoidcontractorfraud\">Why homeowners need to avoid contractor fraud</h2>\n<p>You might be asking yourself, “So what? Who cares? Isn’t this the insurance company’s problem?” Oh, if wishing made it so.</p>\n<p>Contractor fraud has significant effects on homeowners who fall victim to the scam. These homeowners end up with poor claims histories that can lead to homeowners seeing drastic rate increases – or even difficulty getting coverage at all. In fact, <a href=\"/blog/assignment-of-benefits-florida/\">AOB benefit scams in Florida</a> are one major reason why rates are continuing to climb so fast in that state.</p>\n<p>Plus, if an insurance company finds that a homeowner was in any way complicit with the fraud – or had reason to suspect one was being committed – the homeowner may face legal consequences as well.</p>\n<p>Insurance fraud also has significant impacts on the <a href=\"https://insurancefraud.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Impact-of-Insurance-Fraud-on-the-U.S.-Economy-Report-2022-8.26.2022.pdf\">broader economy as well</a>. When one homeowner in a particular area falls victim to a scam, it can increase the cost of coverage for others in their area. Depending on the size and scale of the fraud, these effects may be amplified as local businesses and property values are impacted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoreportinsurancefraud\">How to report insurance fraud</h2>\n<p>If you think you’ve been solicited by an unlicensed contractor or adjuster or have been asked to fabricate an insurance claim, contact your insurance company immediately.

    body: "<h2 id=\"whathappensafteracatastropheclaim\">What happens after a catastrophe claim?</h2>\n<p>For big disasters, we check in with each customer in the area so if there’s a loss, we can help out faster. We use technology, like satellite imagery and drone footage, to quickly get eyes on the damage, and as soon as we’re able, we get boots on the ground to help you in person.</p>\n<p>This ensures we can get you <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a> quickly to help keep you in your own personal space while the rest of the claim is assessed and addressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisacatastropheclaim\">What is a catastrophe claim?</h2>\n<p>Anyone can have a catastrophic loss at any time, but a catastrophe claim refers to single-event, widespread losses expected to be more than $25 million. These claims can be difficult to process as insurance adjusters may have trouble getting into disaster zones to meet with policyholders.</p>\n<p>Claims associated with the following events are usually deemed catastrophe claims:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hurricane</li>\n<li>Floods</li>\n<li>Wildfires</li>\n<li>Tornado</li>\n<li>Hail</li>\n<li>Civil unrest</li>\n<li>Terrorism</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/article/spotlight-on-catastrophes-insurance-issues#:~:text=An%20event%20is%20designated%20a,and%20insurance%20companies%20are%20affected.\">Insurance Information Institute</a>, catastrophe losses are expected to double every decade or so because of more residential and commercial communities with expensive structures. As <a href=\"/blog/how-climate-change-affects-your-home/\">climate change worsens</a> and more disasters occur, those losses will increase, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoreportacatastropheclaim\">How to report a catastrophe claim</h2>\n<p>Kin customers should contact the <a href=\"/claims/\">Claims Center</a> as soon as they experience a loss of any kind, and especially one that results from a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.</p>\n<p>Have the following information on hand to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">file your claim</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A photo ID.</strong> Once boots are on the ground, your claims professional will need some confirmation of your identity.</li>\n<li><strong>Policy information.</strong> If you don’t have this readily available, our claims professional can help you with the details.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact information.</strong> You may be staying with friends or in a hotel. Make sure we know the best way to reach you.</li>\n<li><strong>Date of loss.</strong> We’ll need to know when the loss occurred.</li>\n<li><strong>Description and photos.</strong> When possible, we’ll need a full description of the losses. Photos and videos are incredibly helpful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that providing as much information during the initial claim intake as possible will help speed up the process.</p>\n<p>If you’re able to safely do so, mitigate losses next. For example, if a waterline bursts and is flooding the area, turn off your water to prevent more damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"followinguponacatastropheclaim\">Following up on a catastrophe claim</h2>\n<p>Keep all your claims information, documentation, receipts, and messages in a safe place – like Dropbox, Google Drive, or a dedicated email folder. This will help you keep track of what’s going on.</p>\n<p>It’s also smart to keep a claims notebook with your emergency supplies so you can easily list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The best way to contact you outside of your home</li>\n<li>Claim number</li>\n<li>Adjuster’s name, email address, and phone number</li>\n<li>Date of loss</li>\n<li>Claim details</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When checking in on your claim, you may be asked for this information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"catastropheclaimtimelines\">Catastrophe claim timelines</h2>\n<p>Our goal is to process every claim as quickly as possible. But when a major disaster impacts entire neighborhoods – or half the state – processing times may vary.</p>\n<p>That said, every Florida homeowner is entitled to a claim acknowledgment within 14 days, claim updates <a href=\"/claims/bill-of-rights/\">within 30 days of submitting proof of loss</a>, and payments or denial notices within 90 days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coveragesyoulllikelyneedinacatastropheclaim\">Coverages you’ll likely need in a catastrophe claim</h2>\n<p>When you file a claim, your claims professional will review your coverage with you. It helps to have your declarations page ready – this summarizes your policy coverages and limits.</p>\n<p>These are the coverages you’ll almost always need for a catastrophe claim:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Coverage A</a>. This protects your home’s structure inside and out – the frame, walls, awnings, electrical systems, plumbing, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-b/\">Coverage B</a>. This pays for damage to other structures on your property, like fences, sheds, and detached garages.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Coverage C</a>. This covers everything you put in your home – your furniture, appliances, clothes, cabinets, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">Coverage D</a>. This helps pay for additional living expenses when a claim forces you to relocate temporarily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Review your coverage every year to make sure it reflects your current needs. You don’t want face a catastrophic claim and come up short. For example, if you have $200,000 worth of belongings but only $60,000 worth of personal property coverage, you won’t have all you need to cover your replacements.</p>\n<p>Coverage D, loss of use coverage, can be a game-changer when you’ve experienced a catastrophic loss. It can help pay for hotel stays, dining out, groceries, laundry, transportation, and more when a claim has displaced you and your family. It’s a way to maintain some comforts of your normal life while we work hard to get the rest back in order.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anoteaboutfederalaid\">A note about federal aid</h2>\n<p>Federal aid often exceeds billions of dollars after a major catastrophe. After Hurricane Michael, FEMA and other federal programs paid out nearly $1.9 billion in aid. But don’t expect to get your house rebuilt on <a href=\"/blog/what-is-femas-role-in-disaster-relief/\">FEMA aid</a>. Not only is aid slow to roll out, but it’s usually limited to small amounts to help people get back on their feet – not rebuild everything from the ground up.</p>\n<p>When you have the right insurance in place, you won’t need to rely on FEMA or government aid to rebuild and regroup. You will have the money to rebuild your home, replace your personal belongings, and money to live somewhere while all that happens.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"howdoinsurancecompaniespayoutclaims\">How do insurance companies pay out claims?</h2>\n<p>Every insurance company is different, and every state has different requirements on <a href=\"/claims/\">claims</a> payout periods. That said, the claims settlement process in general tends to follow these basic steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You file a claim.</li>\n<li>An adjuster is assigned to your case.</li>\n<li>The adjuster assesses the damage.</li>\n<li>The adjuster determines coverage.</li>\n<li>The claim is paid and you make repairs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But how is the claim paid for, exactly? And what determines how much you’ll get? This overview will help you answer those questions so you know what to expect when you file a claim on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">homeowners insurance policy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdamageisassessedduringaclaim\">How damage is assessed during a claim</h2>\n<p>After you file a property damage claim, an <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">insurance adjuster</a> will visit your home to inspect what happened and evaluate the loss. They will consider factors like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The square footage that’s damaged.</li>\n<li>The items that are damaged.</li>\n<li>Whether the damage can be repaired or must be rebuilt or replaced.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">home inventory</a>, be sure to hand a copy over to your adjuster – it helps expedite the process.</p>\n<p>Once the adjuster documents all the damage, they use software to determine the value of the damage based on your home’s square footage and construction materials. They also crunch the estimates and receipts you provide to repair or replace damaged items. Then they take a look at what coverage your policy provides.</p>\n<p>Your representative will review your policy with you, from your <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">dwelling coverage</a> to <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">personal belongings</a> and <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use</a>, and explain what is and isn’t covered and to what extent. The type of coverage you have impacts your claims payout, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howactualcashvaluevsreplacementcostclaimsarepaid\">How actual cash value vs. replacement cost claims are paid</h2>\n<p>When you buy your policy, you may get the option to insure your home and belongings based on their <a href=\"/glossary/actual-cash-value/\">actual cash value</a> or <a href=\"/glossary/replacement-cost/\">replacement cost</a>. This can make a big difference in your claim payout.</p>\n<p>If your property is insured for its actual cash value, the claim is paid out based on the property’s depreciated value. So say you bought a fridge for $800 10 years ago. Depreciation is usually calculated using a formula like this: R × (E - C) / E = ACV.</p>\n<p>R = replacement cost of the item</p>\n<p>E = expected life (lifespan) of the item</p>\n<p>C = current life of the item</p>\n<p>ACV = actual cash value</p>\n<p>So if your fridge has an expected life of 15 years, your payout comes to $266.</p>\n<p>$800 × (15 - 10) / 15 = $266</p>\n<p>On the other hand, replacement cost coverage offers the amount it takes to replace the item with a new, similar item at today’s market rate. So that $800 refrigerator might cost $1,000 today, and that would be what the insurance company allows to replace it.</p>\n<p>However, don’t expect that replacement cost payout in one lump sum. Most insurers will pay out the actual cash value of the item, and then a second payment when you show the receipt that proves you’d replaced the item. Then you’ll get the final payment.</p>\n<p>You can often submit your expenses along the way if you replace items over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdeductiblesworkinaclaimssettlement\">How deductibles work in a claims settlement</h2>\n<p>Your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a> is the amount you cover when you file a claim. If your loss is less than the deductible, you won’t receive any payment from your insurer.</p>\n<p>When your loss is more than your deductible, you’ll receive the agreed upon payment minus your deductible. So say your roof was damaged in a hurricane, and it will cost $15,000 to replace. If you have a $2,000 deductible, your payout would be $13,000. That means you will have to come up with the $2,000 to pay the contractor to complete the work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howclaimsettlementsworkifyouhaveamortgage\">How claim settlements work if you have a mortgage</h2>\n<p>Claims may be paid differently if you have a mortgage because your lender has a vested interest in your home getting repaired. Lenders are named as additional insureds on a policy, and that usually means the check will be issued to you and the mortgage company for the actual structure of the house. Personal property checks are payable only to you.</p>\n<p>A check made payable to both of you can be hard to navigate, and that’s the point. The lender wants to make sure that the repairs are done instead of letting a homeowner walk away from a total loss with the payout in hand.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, an insurance company will release payments at project milestones. When the work is completed and passes inspection, the lender will sign off on the final check. Chances are the bank will require the check to be signed over to any contractor that is performing the work if the insurance company isn’t working directly with the contractor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howlongittakestogetaclaimsettlement\">How long it takes to get a claim settlement</h2>\n<p>Your state’s insurance commissioner usually outlines how long an insurance company has to pay your claim.</p>\n<p>For example, Florida has a <a href=\"/claims/bill-of-rights/\">homeowners' bill of rights</a> that says insurance companies have 90 days from the start of a claim to send a full payment based on the claim’s approval. (We often work much faster than that, though.)</p>\n<p>At Kin, you can choose to receive your funds by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct deposit.</li>\n<li>A printable electronic check.</li>\n<li>A mailed check.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a question about making a claim or getting a claim settlement from your Kin policy, feel free to call us at <a href=\"tel:866-204-2219\">866-204-2219</a> or email claims@kin.com<a href=\"/faq/\">.</a></p>"

Provide the adjuster with your home inventory and photos of lost items so they can add it to the file.</li>\n<li><strong>Get an estimate of the damage.</strong> You claims adjuster will prepare an estimate of your total damages, review their findings, and determine whether your insurance policy covers the loss and to what extent.</li>\n<li><strong>Get your claims payment.</strong> Your claims adjuster will issue payment based on your policy so you can get repairs underway.</li>\n<li><strong>Take a bow.</strong> At this stage, your claim is considered resolved. Well done!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whattoexpectafterfilingahomeownersinsuranceclaim\">What to expect after filing a homeowners insurance claim</h2>\n<p>Once the claim adjuster comes to inspect the damage, they will create a loss report. This may take up to 14 days to complete. During this time, you should also receive a <a href=\"/claims/bill-of-rights/\">Claims Bill of Rights</a> from your insurance company, if you live in Florida. Review it so you know your rights and the claims timeline.</p>\n<p>The adjuster will guide you on how to turn in receipts for items and estimates for damage repairs. Submit these to the adjuster as you get them.</p>\n<p>If you have our <a href=\"/faq/managed-repair-program/\">Managed Repair Network</a> endorsement, we'll connect you with local and licensed service providers that can help you get estimates.</p>\n<p>Once repair costs are approved, the work begins. Contractors will ask you to sign a release so that they can get paid directly from your insurer for the work performed. This way, you aren’t out of pocket for the expenses waiting for reimbursement.</p>\n<p>If your belongings are lost or damaged and the claim is approved, you'll get a payment so you can replace them.</p>\n<p>For Florida, your complete claim will be approved or denied within 90 days.</p>\n<p>If you dispute the claim, you may be able to take advantage of mediation though the Florida Department of Financial Services Division of Consumer Services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtomitigatepostdamagelosses\">How to mitigate post-damage losses</h2>\n<p>While you can't prevent every loss, it's your responsibility to take reasonable steps to lessen the severity of the loss. For example, you might take steps to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-hurricane/\">prepare your home for a hurricane</a> or curb losses after an incident happens.</p>\n<p>For example, you might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call the police or fire department to intervene in a break-in or fire respectively.</li>\n<li>Turn the water off when a pipe bursts.</li>\n<li>Board up a broken window after a burglary.</li>\n<li>Put a tarp over the hole in the roof after a tree falls on your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, exercise common sense and caution. Do not put your safety at risk. Ask your insurance company if you have questions about how to proceed with a loss.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to take safe actions to mitigate losses, be sure to document your reasons and explain them to your adjuster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"canyoudorepairsbeforetheadjusterarrives\">Can you do repairs before the adjuster arrives?</h2>\n<p>Wait for an adjuster to be assigned to your claim and to investigate the loss before you make any repairs. You want your adjuster to be able to evaluate the full extent of the damage. Otherwise, you risk not being reimbursed for work done or getting a smaller payout than you should.</p>\n<p>That said, if you are in immediate need of repairs for safety or health reasons, explain this to your claims representative. It is possible to get the repairs done in emergency scenarios and provide a receipt for the work. In this case, we often want a licensed contractor, ideally within the Managed Repair Network, to provide an estimate and complete the work.</p>"

Let’s learn more about them and find out how you can reduce your chance of claims by proactively safeguarding your home. Bonus: Your safety measures may even qualify you for <a href=\"/faq/how-to-lower-home-insurance-premium/\">lower home insurance premiums</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1windandhaildamage\">1. Wind and hail damage</h2>\n<p>A strong windstorm may knock a few shingles loose whereas tornado winds can impact an entire home. As with any loss, it’s smart to weigh the cost of the potential repair against your deductible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stepstomitigatewindhaildamages\">Steps to mitigate wind &amp; hail damages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Check your roof regularly for loose shingles. If something looks out of place, get a professional to inspect or make repairs.</li>\n<li>Secure outdoor furniture before a storm. This includes patio furniture, grills, kids swing sets, trampolines or toys, or any large item that might cause damage if the wind lifts it.</li>\n<li>Check your trees and shrubs regularly. Trim all overhanging limbs and remove dead branches that might fall on your home during a storm.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"2waterdamage\">2. Water damage</h2>\n<p>If a pipe bursts in your home or an appliance leaks, shut off the water immediately. Doing so may save you hundreds on the cleanup and repairs.</p>\n<p>Note: While <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">standard home insurance may cover water damage</a> from burst pipes, you need a flood insurance policy to address water damage from storm surges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stepstomitigatewaterdamage\">Steps to mitigate water damage</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Look into water sensors – they work! Place the sensors on and around pipes and appliances. They will alert you once a leak is detected so you can take action right away.</li>\n<li>Set up an automatic shutoff system. This will shut off the water supply once a problem is detected.</li>\n<li>Inspect all water supply lines, drain lines, toilets, sinks, tubs, and appliances regularly. Look for leaks, unblock clogged or slow-moving drains, and caulk around worn areas to prevent leaking.</li>\n<li>Watch out for snow and ice build-up on your roof and in your gutters. It can cause leaks, so if you see it, safely remove it.</li>\n<li>Check for water pooling around the foundation. Correct grading issues so that water flows away from your property.</li>\n<li>Inspect your gutters and downspouts for proper water flow.

Electrical fires are the common causes of fire, so inspect your outlets, all extension cords, surge protectors, and all cords to ensure there’s no fraying.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"4slipsandfallsonyourproperty\">4. Slips and falls on your property</h2>\n<p>When guests and visitors are hurt on your property, or if you cause their property damage, you can be held responsible for their expenses.

Theft</h2>\n<p>Though you can’t control the actions of others, you can take steps to make your home less attractive for would-be thieves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stepstomitigatetheft\">Steps to mitigate theft</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Keep your home’s exterior doors and windows locked.</li>\n<li>Don’t leave your car unlocked, even when you’re at home.</li>\n<li>Never leave keys or a garage door opener in an unlocked car.</li>\n<li>Consider installing a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">home security system</a>, such as security cameras, smart doorbells, motion-activated exterior lighting, and interior motion sensors.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: If you are considering higher-end security or safety upgrades to reduce your <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">homeowners insurance costs</a>, check with your insurer first to make sure it’s eligible for a discount.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/faq/\"><strong>← BACK TO FAQ</strong></a></p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"insuranceclaimshistoryonahouse\">Insurance claims history on a house</h2>\n<p>Homeowners insurance <a href=\"/glossary/claim/\">claims</a> typically stay on a national property claim database called the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) for <strong>five to seven years</strong>. Every time you file a claim, your insurance company reports the case to either CLUE or A-PLUS (Automated Property Loss Underwriting System), the other major claims database.</p>\n<p>As you probably know, your claims history matters when you switch insurance companies or take out a new policy. Every insurer will scope out your recent claims history to help price your policy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <h4 id=\"homeownersinsuranceclaimsusuallystayonyourrecordforfivetosevenyears\"><strong>Homeowners insurance claims usually stay on your record for five to seven years.</strong></h4>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"howyourclaimshistoryimpactsyourhomeownersinsurancerates\">How your claims history impacts your homeowners insurance rates</h2>\n<p>The more claims you have on your record, the harder it may be to find affordable, reliable coverage. That’s because many insurance companies raise rates or limit coverage if your home has a history of recent losses.</p>\n<p>Your insurance company may also <a href=\"/blog/homeowners-insurance-non-renewal/\">refuse to renew your policy</a> after a spate of claims.</p>\n<p>That’s why it’s wise to use caution before you file a claim – you don’t want to inadvertently file a lot of small claims that drive up your policy cost or make you uninsurable in the future. In general, try to only file a claim when it’s at least two to three times higher than your deductible.</p>\n<p>It’s also smart to take steps to <a href=\"/faq/how-to-prevent-claims/\">prevent claims</a> from happening. In fact, many companies offer discounts for some risk management measures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whichhomeownersinsuranceclaimsincreaseratesthemost\">Which homeowners insurance claims increase rates the most?</h2>\n<p>Some claims <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-premium-factors/\">impact your rates</a> more than others. The following types of claims have the most impact on your premium or coverage eligibility because homeowners can usually take some steps to reduce the chance of these losses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\"><strong>Water damage</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Think burst pipes, leaky faucets, or flooded appliances. These claims are largely viewed as preventable, and therefore may impact your more.</li>\n<li><strong>Liability.</strong> If someone falls in your home or is hurt in your swimming pool, that claim may drive up the cost of your insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Fires.</strong> These tend to be the most expensive claims, averaging $68,322, which is why fire claims might have more impact on your record.</li>\n<li><strong>Theft.</strong> Too many break-ins may signal to an insurance company that you aren’t taking steps to secure your property.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/glossary/animal-liability/\"><strong>Dog bites</strong></a><strong>.</strong> All dogs are good dogs, but a dog with a bite history may increase your premium or not be covered by your policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following claims (also called <a href=\"/glossary/catastrophic-coverage/\">catastrophic claims</a>) may have less of an impact on your coverage eligibility. That’s because these claims are weather dependent, and insurance companies acknowledge homeowners can’t control the weather:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wind and hail damage</li>\n<li>Hurricane wind and flood damage</li>\n<li>Lightning damage</li>\n<li>Freezing damage</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howmanyhomeownersclaimsistoomany\">How many homeowners claims is too many?</h2>\n<p>Generally, if you haven’t filed more than one non-catastrophic loss claim in three years, and have no <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">liability</a> losses in three years, you may still be eligible for coverage.</p>\n<p>Two claims in five years may drive up the cost of your coverage. More than two claims in a five-year period may make it difficult to find coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheretofindyourclaimshistory\">Where to find your claims history</h2>\n<p>Thanks to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you can <a href=\"https://consumer.risk.lexisnexis.com/request\">request one free copy</a> of your loss history report from CLUE per year. In addition to your name, home address, and Social Security number, the report includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The report reference number</li>\n<li>The name of your insurance company</li>\n<li>The type and number of the insurance policy</li>\n<li>The type of loss that triggered the claim: fire, theft, etc.</li>\n<li>The claim number</li>\n<li>The date of the loss</li>\n<li>The amount of each claim</li>\n<li>The status of each claim: closed, pending, etc.</li>\n<li>Damage reports that were closed due to owner repair (depending on the state)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Worth noting:</strong> your CLUE report is tied to your home’s address. So even if you haven’t filed a claim, the previous owner’s claims may appear on the home’s loss history. That’s why it’s important to ask for this report <a href=\"/blog/flood-disclosure-laws/\">before you purchase a home</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also request your property loss report from A-PLUS, which does charge for the report unless an insurer turned you down because of A-PLUS data.</p>\n<p>That’s true for CLUE, too – any time an insurer refuses to insure your home because of its report, you can get a free copy of it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtodisputeyourclaimsreport\">How to dispute your claims report</h2>\n<p>So let’s say you think your claims report might have an error. You can take two routes to dispute your CLUE report:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can submit an explanation of the loss that will appear on all future reports (the loss will still appear on your report).</li>\n<li>You can dispute incorrect information and try to get it removed from your report.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For either option, your first step is to contact <a href=\"https://consumer.risk.lexisnexis.com/\">LexisNexis</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to submit an explanation, prepare a statement about the loss in 100 words or fewer to include in future reports. The report will be updated with your statement within 30 days.</p>\n<p>For a dispute, you’ll need to include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your CLUE report reference number</li>\n<li>The claim number and name of the insurance company that handled the loss</li>\n<li>A short account of the error</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LexisNexis will reach out to your insurance company to verify your account. If the insurance company rejects your dispute, the loss will remain on your record.</p>\n<p>To learn more about claims, <a href=\"/claims/\">visit our Claims Center</a>.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whendoinsurancelossinspectionshappen\">When do insurance loss inspections happen?</h2>\n<p>An insurance loss inspection is simply an evaluation of the damage you experienced. It usually takes place within 48 hours of filing a <a href=\"/claims/\">claim</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, say a hurricane sent a tree through your roof, leaving your home exposed to heavy rain. A <a href=\"/glossary/adjuster/\">claims adjuster</a> would visit your home to look over the damage, get the scoop on what happened, and collect data to determine the value of the loss, from your tree-torn roof to your water-damaged belongings.</p>\n<p>Once you <a href=\"/faq/how-to-file-a-claim/\">file a claim</a>, we’ll reach out as soon as possible to arrange a loss inspection (if necessary). It’s best to move quickly because it means:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The claim gets settled faster.</li>\n<li>The potential for unrelated damage that could complicate your claim is less likely.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another benefit of loss inspections? They help deter fraudulent claims, and less fraud keeps insurance prices low.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforalossinspection\">How to prepare for a loss inspection</h2>\n<p>To make sure the inspection goes smoothly, plan ahead.</p>\n<p>Take photos of the damages as soon as you safely can. You may need to mitigate further damage, too. For example, if a pipe burst and the living room is filled with water, you’ll want to take pictures both before and after you remove the water as best as you can to prevent more losses.</p>\n<p>Keep all receipts from remediation services or temporary repairs. For example, if someone broke a window during a robbery, you may have temporarily boarded up the space to keep out the elements and unwanted visitors.</p>\n<p>Don’t throw away damaged items. <a href=\"/faq/what-is-home-inventory/\">Inventory</a> them, store them, and protect them so the adjuster can see the items as they are. While pictures are good, the actual item will tell a more complete story.</p>\n<p>When the claims adjuster comes, secure your pets so the inspector has free access to the area. Don’t be surprised if they measure the room to draw and document the scale of the damage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whattoexpectafterthelossinspection\">What to expect after the loss inspection</h2>\n<p>After the loss inspection, your claims specialist will prepare an estimate of damages and review your homeowners policy to see how much coverage applies. The final assessment shows what’s covered and what isn’t.</p>\n<p>If the total damage is less than your deductible, you’ll be notified that the claim isn’t eligible for coverage. (Learn more about <a href=\"/faq/when-to-file-a-claim/\">when to file a claim here</a>.) If the damage is more than your deductible and covered by your policy, you will receive payment for the cost of repairs and replacements (minus your deductible). So if your deductible is $2,000 and your claim is valued at $10,000, you would receive $8,000.</p>\n<p>If you have a mortgage, your lender may be included as a payee to protect their interests in the property and ensure repairs are made.</p>\n<p>You have a <a href=\"/claims/bill-of-rights/\">bill of rights</a>, too. In Florida, your claim must be acknowledged within 14 days. Once you have a proof-of-loss statement, you have a right to know within 30 days if your claim is covered and to what extent. Covered claims should be paid within 90 days from the day the proof-of-loss statement was sent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howlossinspectionshelppreventfraud\">How loss inspections help prevent fraud</h2>\n<p>The FBI estimates more than <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/insurance-fraud\">$40 billion</a> in fraudulent property and casualty claims happen each year. And fraud costs everyone big time, not just insurers. To account for fraudulent losses, policyholders may see premiums increase. On average, fraud costs the average family between $400 and $700 a year.</p>\n<p>Insurance loss inspections are an opportunity for an adjuster to see what happened firsthand. They can inspect the property, evaluate the loss and how it occurred, and determine whether the account of what happened matches the damage. If the adjuster suspects fraud, the claim can be investigated further.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whentofileahomeinsuranceclaim\">When to file a home insurance claim</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Home insurance</a> is for disasters big and small. But when you don’t have a total loss (think: a home completely flooded by a hurricane or destroyed by wildfires), it can be hard to determine what losses warrant a claim.</p>\n<p>Before we dive in, know that these are suggestions and best practices, not advice. It’s totally up to you when you choose to use your policy and file a claim.</p>\n<p>Here are some signs it might make sense to file a claim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1thecostofrepairsismorethanyourdeductible\">1. The cost of repairs is more than your deductible</h2>\n<p>If a loss will cost significantly more than your insurance deductible to repair or replace your property, filing a claim may be the way to go. If the cost is less than your deductible, your insurance wouldn’t kick in until that deductible is met. You’d be paying that amount out of pocket either way, and filing a claim would only increase your premium.</p>\n<p>But what do you do when the loss value is somewhere in between?</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some examples to give you a better idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Your deck’s support beam has slowly been eaten by termites and collapses. Because <a href=\"/blog/does-home-insurance-cover-termite-damage/\">termite damage</a> is considered a wear-and-tear issue, the claim would likely be denied if you filed it. Even a denied claim on your record can cause your premiums to go up with some insurance companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Your pipe burst 18 months ago, and you made a claim valued at $40,000 to repair your bathroom cabinets, floors, walls, and some of the carpet in the hallway. But now you have a second pipe failure that caused $5,000 in damages. You have a $2,000 deductible. Your insurance premiums already went up with the first claim and will go up even more with the second (or risk being cancelled in some cases). This may be a time to pay out of pocket.</p>\n<p><strong>The takeaway: Your claims history, the amount of damage, and what your policy covers all play a role in when to file a claim.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"2youveexperiencedatotalloss\">2. You’ve experienced a total loss</h2>\n<p>This is when you really need your insurance to come through. Your policy is designed to cover unexpected incidents that make your home uninhabitable. If you have a total loss that your policy covers, filing a claim is a no-brainer and the quickest way to get your life back to normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3youhaventfiledaclaiminmorethan3years\">3. You haven’t filed a claim in more than 3 years</h2>\n<p>Every homeowner has a Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) report, which is a comprehensive record of your entire <a href=\"/faq/insurance-claims-history/\">loss history</a>. Claims usually stay on this report for seven years.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies use this report to help them predict how likely you are to file a claim in the future. The more claims you have on your record, the more likely you are to file a claim (statistically speaking), and the higher your premiums may be. The reverse is also true: a claims-free record is usually awarded with lower rates.</p>\n<p>Most insurance companies pay particular attention to the last three years of your loss history. If you go three years without another claim, the incident may be considered isolated and your premiums may go back down. You can use this timeframe to gauge when filing a claim might make sense if you’re on the fence and already have a claims history.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have a claims history, the typical premium increase is about 9 percent, but that depends on your insurer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whennottofileahomeinsuranceclaim\">When not to file a home insurance claim</h2>\n<p>Being savvy about when to file and when to repair on your own can help you save more on insurance in the long run. Here are some instances when you probably don’t want to file a claim:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repair costs are less than your deductible.</li>\n<li>The loss is caused by normal wear and tear.</li>\n<li>You had a recent claim within the past three years.</li>\n<li>The cost of repairs is barely more than your deductible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"top5reasonshomeinsuranceclaimsgetdenied\">Top 5 reasons home insurance claims get denied</h2>\n<p>If you’ve run the numbers but still aren’t sure if you should file a claim for fear it will be denied, it helps to know what causes a claim to get turned down for coverage. These are the top reasons insurers deny claims:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The damage was caused by a</strong> <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\"><strong>non-covered peril</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Say your sewer backs up and causes your basement to flood. If you don’t have <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water backup coverage</a>, the claim would not be covered.</li>\n<li><strong>The damage was caused by</strong> <a href=\"/blog/wear-and-tear-isnt-covered/\"><strong>normal wear and tear</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Homeowners are expected to do regular upkeep on their homes to keep them in good working order. So if your roof is in disrepair from old age and you experience a leak, that damage might not be covered. But if a tree falls through your roof and you get a leak, that’s a different story (and usually covered by insurance).</li>\n<li><strong>The damage could have been avoided.</strong> Insurance doesn’t cover intentional or avoidable acts. For example, if you didn’t turn the water off in the house before trying to fix your pipes, that could be considered an avoidable incident.</li>\n<li><strong>The damage happened too long ago.</strong> Every state has statutes of limitations for filing claims – otherwise, it would be too hard to assess whether actions or activity increased damage over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Your policy lapsed.</strong> If your policy has lapsed when the damage occurred, you will not have coverage for the claim.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember: your insurance company is there to help you. If you’re not sure whether to file a claim, ask. Most insurers won’t force you into a claim or stop you from filing one. Ask a lot of questions to make sure you're comfortable with the likelihood of getting the claim approved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howclaimsimpactyourpremium\">How claims impact your premium</h2>\n<p>Insurance rates don’t go up based on the value of the claim. They go up simply because you had a claim. But some types of claims do impact your rates more than others.</p>\n<p>For example, catastrophic claims (think: wildfires and hurricanes) have less impact on your rates than, say, a dog bite or theft claim. The logic is that you may have slightly more control over those losses, whereas no one can control a hurricane.</p>\n<p>That said, on average, premiums go up about <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2014/10/19/real_estate/homeowners-insurance-claims/index.html#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20filing%20a%20single,by%20an%20average%20of%2020%25.\">9 percent after a first claim</a> and 20 percent after a second claim. That’s because decades of data shows that someone who has one claim is very likely to have another claim within three years. The claims tend to get more expensive each time, too.</p>\n<p>That said, your policy is meant to help you deal with acute losses. Use it when you really need it.</p>"
