    body: "<h2 id=\"commonhomeinsurancediscounts\">Common home insurance discounts</h2>\n<p>You don’t want to spend more on home insurance than you have to – and you shouldn’t. Our whole jam is to help you get easy, reliable coverage at a great price. That's why we help you take advantage of every available home insurance discount.</p>\n<p>Every company has their own discounts and savings amounts. We’re going to focus on the discounts we do offer, but we will explore some additional common discounts, too.</p>\n<p>As always, if you ever have questions about what discounts you qualify for, just ask! We’re happy to crunch the numbers and help you get every opportunity to save on your <a href=\"/home-insurance/homeowners-insurance-cost/\">homeowners insurance costs</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1fireandsecurityalarmdiscount\">1. Fire and security alarm discount</h3>\n<p>You know these devices – these are your monitored smoke alarms, motion sensors and cameras, and security system. These devices help you make your home safer and minimize the chance or severity of a fire or theft claim, which is why most insurance companies offer a discount for them. The logic is that the faster the fire department or police can respond to a fire or break-in, the fewer losses you’ll have. Plus, security systems may deter thieves, which reduces your chance of experiencing a break-in in the first place.</p>\n<p>Insurance companies may differ on which type of system qualifies for a discount. Most only accept <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">centrally monitored systems</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2waterleakdetectionandmitigationdevicediscount\">2. Water leak detection and mitigation device discount</h3>\n<p>These devices are getting more affordable each day, and many water detection systems are smartphone-ready so you can get leak alerts anywhere. Some systems even have automatic water shut-offs. Because water damage can be costly, insurers are eager to reward homeowners who take measures to reduce or offset the chance of leaks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3windmitigationcredits\">3. Wind mitigation credits</h3>\n<p>Florida homeowners know how important a roof is: it can be the difference between a home being completely destroyed or staying intact during a hurricane. The more wind-resistant your roof is, the more you’ll save on your home insurance. To qualify for these credits, homes must have a roof covering, roof-deck attachment, roof-wall connection, attachment opening protection, hip shape roof, and secondary water resistance. A <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">wind mitigation inspection</a> is typically required.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4firemitigationdiscount\">4. Fire mitigation discount</h3>\n<p>If you live in California, you may benefit from the steps you take to make your home more resistant to wildfires. Insurers like Kin offer discounts for ember-resistant venting, having an annual brush removal contract in place, and for complying with defensible space regulations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5claimsfreediscount\">5. Claims-free discount</h3>\n<p>If you haven’t filed a claim in more than seven years (that’s about the <a href=\"/faq/insurance-claims-history/\">time it takes for a claim to drop off your CLUE report</a>), you may qualify for a claim-free discount. Policyholders who don’t have recent claims on their record may be considered less likely to file a claim in the near future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6responsiblerepairdiscount\">6. Responsible repair discount</h3>\n<p>This is a Kin-only discount – and we’re pretty proud of that. We created the <a href=\"/faq/responsible-repair-discount/\">Responsible Repair Discount</a> in response to Florida’s assignment of benefits reform. Essentially, legislators made it more difficult for contractors to take advantage of homeowners who file claims and need repairs. Our discount works similarly. Our policyholders get this discount when they agree not to sign their claims benefits over to a contractor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7accreditedbuilderdiscount\">7. Accredited builder discount</h3>\n<p>If your home was built less than six years ago by an accredited builder – that is, an active builder who provides a warranty covering wall-to-wall defects in the workmanship or materials – you may qualify for this discount.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8electronicpolicydiscount\">8. Electronic policy discount</h3>\n<p>In an effort to reduce carbon footprints and paper use, many insurance companies (Kin included) are encouraging policyholders to go green and manage their policies online. In many cases, this is a $10 discount – not bad for something you might’ve been planning to do regardless.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9communitybaseddiscounts\">9. Community-based discounts</h3>\n<p>You may qualify for discounts if your home belongs to a homeowners association, is in a mobile park, or is part of a secured community. The logic here is that HOAs and mobile home parks typically have quality standards for home maintenance. A well managed home may have fewer liability exposures. Plus, these communities may have neighborhood watches that decrease break-ins.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a home in a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-secured-community/\">secured community</a> means it has a single entry, 24-hour security patrol, pass-key gates at all entrances, or 24-hour manned gates. Homes in these communities are more difficult to burglarize and therefore more attractive to insurance companies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"10maturehomeownerdiscount\">10. Mature homeowner discount</h3>\n<p>Homeowners 55 and older are eligible for discounts because with age comes wisdom! At least from a risk perspective, older homeowners tend to be responsible. They are home more often, which may deter break-ins. They also typically don't throw rambunctious parties that could quickly become a liability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11newhomeownerdiscount\">11. New homeowner discount</h3>\n<p>Buying a new home is exciting, and many insurers want to be your first pick for protecting it. That’s why insurance companies often offer a discount if you bought your home within the last 12 months.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12leedcertifiedhomediscount\">12. LEED-certified home discount</h3>\n<p>A LEED-certified home, or a home that meets the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System, an environmental building standard, may be eligible for a homeowners insurance discount depending on the insurer and the state. For example, Kin offers this discount to California homeowners. It’s a small way to incentivize sustainability and energy efficiency because on average, LEED-certified homes use 20 to 30 percent less energy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13payinfulldiscount\">13. Pay in full discount</h3>\n<p>Homeowners insurance companies often charge a <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-fees/\">small processing fee</a> (like $3) per premium installment payment. That isn’t much, but it can add up if you opt for a 10-pay installment plan – you’d pay $30 extra over the course of the year. That’s why some companies offer a small discount to encourage paying the premium all at once.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kininsurancediscountsataglance\">Kin insurance discounts at a glance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"floridahomeownersinsurancediscountshomeinsuranceflorida\"><a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance discounts</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire, water, and security devices</li>\n<li>Wind mitigation</li>\n<li>Responsible Repair</li>\n<li>Claims-free</li>\n<li>Electronic policy</li>\n<li>Secured community</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mobilehomeinsurancediscountsmobilehomeinsurance\"><a href=\"/mobile-home-insurance/\">Mobile home insurance discounts</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire, water, and security devices</li>\n<li>Mature homeowner</li>\n<li>Claims-free</li>\n<li>Electronic policy</li>\n<li>In community</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"californiahomeinsurancediscounts\">California home insurance discounts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ember resistant venting</li>\n<li>Annual brush removal contract</li>\n<li>Defensible space compliant</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/leed-certified-home/\">LEED-certified home</a></li>\n<li>Smart home safety and security devices</li>\n<li>Homeowners association</li>\n<li>New homebuyer</li>\n<li>Claims-free</li>\n<li>Accredited builder</li>\n</ul>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"whatimpactsmyhomeinsurancepremium\">What impacts my home insurance premium?</h2>\n<p>Your home insurance premium is based on a number of variables that tell insurers about your risk. For example, your location is a major factor in your rates – some regions, like California, may be more prone to wildfires, whereas coastal homes in Florida face hurricane risk. Your neighborhood even says something about your likelihood of experiencing a claim: gated communities, for example, may be less prone to property theft than unsecured neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>Here are the most common factors that impact your home insurance costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourhomescharacteristics\">Your home’s characteristics</h2>\n<p>Your home's traits are a significant factor in how much your coverage costs – and the types of coverage you may need. For instance, your premium may be impacted by the home's:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Construction.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">Type of roof</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/how-to-calculate-square-footage-of-a-house/\">Square footage</a>.</li>\n<li>Age.</li>\n<li>Value.</li>\n<li>Other structures on the property (fence, garage, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these components determine how much it would cost to rebuild your home if disaster strikes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourlocation\">Your location</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, where you live impacts your homeowners insurance premium. Areas with a history of above-average crime rates may have higher premiums. Similarly, areas with greater exposure to natural disasters such as <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flooding</a> and <a href=\"/home-insurance/hurricane-insurance/\">hurricanes</a> may also increase rates. By contrast, homes close to a staffed fire station tend to have lower premiums.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourdeductibles\">Your deductibles</h2>\n<p>The amount you are willing to pay toward a claim will either lower or raise your premiums. Typically, the higher your deductible, the lower your premium will be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourriskmanagement\">Your risk management</h2>\n<p>Depending on where you live, your premium may change based on your home's security. For example, Kin customers can get a discount for <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">centrally monitored security alarms</a>. Sprinkler systems and automatic water shut off systems may also qualify you for a reduced premium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourclaimshistory\">Your claims history</h2>\n<p>Premiums are influenced by the number of claims you have made in the past. Insurers often offer lower premiums to policyholders with a clean claims history.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourbackground\">Your background</h2>\n<p>Folks with a <a href=\"/blog/home-insurance-score-explained/\">good insurance score</a> tend to have lower premiums. Your age can also affect your premium – seniors may even qualify for discounts. Likewise, new homeowners may also qualify for discounted rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourpersonalbelongings\">Your personal belongings</h2>\n<p>If you have a lot of valuable property – heirloom jewelry, antiques, artwork, etc. – you may need additional personal property protection to adequately protect your belongings. While it may cost a little extra to <a href=\"/glossary/scheduled-personal-property/\">schedule these items</a>, it does ensure you are appropriately compensated if they are lost or stolen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yourlandlordstatus\">Your landlord status</h2>\n<p>If you rent out your property, you may need additional coverage to address the risks you take on as a <a href=\"/home-insurance/landlord-insurance/\">landlord</a>. As you might've guessed, the more coverage you need, the more your premium may be.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"9tipstoloweryourhomeinsurancecosts\">9 tips to lower your home insurance costs</h2>\n<p>Our premiums are already affordable but the money-saving tips below can help you reduce them even further.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1shoparound\">1. Shop around</h3>\n<p>Because mortgage lenders require homeowners insurance, most people tend to take out a policy with whichever company their real estate agent recommends. However, the best way to get an affordable policy is to <a href=\"/blog/how-to-compare-home-insurance/\">compare quotes from several insurance providers</a>.</p>\n<p>Don't consider price alone. Look at the amount of coverage and what the policy protects. Check out the company's customer reviews and how easy it is to <a href=\"/claims/\">file a claim</a>, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2increaseyourdeductible\">2. Increase your deductible</h3>\n<p>This is one of the easiest ways to save on your homeowners insurance premium. The higher the deductible you choose, the lower your premium will be. When you file a claim, your <a href=\"/glossary/standard-deductible/\">deductible</a> is the amount subtracted from your insurance payout.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, it's smart not to take on a higher deductible than you can comfortably spare out of pocket. If you're not sure what deductible amount is appropriate for your financial situation, ask us for guidance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3dontoverinsure\">3. Don’t over insure</h3>\n<p>Make sure you accurately value your home when choosing how much coverage to purchase. Tools are available to help you determine the replacement cost of rebuilding your home in the event of a claim.</p>\n<p>The purchase price is a starting point but this includes the value of your land, which is not something you'd have to replace after a covered loss. Multiplying the local labor and construction costs by the square footage of your home is one way to estimate your home's replacement cost. This baseline can help you avoid under or over insuring your home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4chooseanannualpayment\">4. Choose an annual payment</h3>\n<p>Paying monthly may be more convenient, but an annual payment usually saves you the most money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5improveyourhomesecurity\">5. Improve your home security</h3>\n<p>Many insurance providers (including Kin) offer a discount for a <a href=\"/faq/what-is-a-central-alarm/\">centrally monitored security alarm</a>, smoke detectors, and dead-bolt locks. If you don't already have a security system, ask your provider how much the discount is – the savings may offset the cost of installing the alarm.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6makeyourhomesafer\">6. Make your home safer</h3>\n<p>Making your home safer can also reduce your insurance bill. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear brush and trim trees around your house.</strong> This reduces the damage in case of a fire or a windstorm knocks down branches.</li>\n<li><strong>Hurricane-proof your home.</strong> <a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">Wind mitigation</a> is essential when you live in a coastal area. Look for ways to reduce the risk of hurricane damage, such as installing storm shutters and doors and upgrading your roof to a reinforced one. Learn more about wind mitigation here.</li>\n<li><strong>Update your roof.</strong> A <a href=\"/blog/whats-in-a-roof/\">new roof</a> can help you qualify for lower rates. In some areas, you could save 10 percent or more on your insurance.</li>\n<li><strong>Upgrade the electrical, heating, and plumbing systems.</strong> Some insurers offer significant savings for new systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Install a backup generator.</strong> Ask your insurer before you make this investment, but some insurers will offering a small discount for this precaution.</li>\n<li><strong>Install an automatic water shut-off system.</strong> This system detects leaks and shuts off your water before you have a flood on your hands.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"7reviewyourpolicyannually\">7. Review your policy annually</h3>\n<p>Your home changes each year, and your coverage needs may change, too. When your policy is up for renewal, take time to evaluate what updates you've made to the home, what new belongings you've acquired (or parted with), and see if you may be eligible for discounts that weren't available to you before.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8improveyourcreditscore\">8. Improve your credit score</h3>\n<p>Insurers review your credit history to help determine your premium. As you might have guessed, a good credit score may help you nab lower home insurance rates.</p>\n<p>Before you apply for insurance or renew your policy, see if you can make improvements to your credit score. The following can have a big impact on your score:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay your bills on time each month</li>\n<li>Keep credit utilization under 30 percent of your available balance</li>\n<li>Pay off your credit card balance every month</li>\n<li>Don’t open new lines of credit</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"9limityourclaims\">9. Limit your claims</h3>\n<p>If you can, save claims for dire situations only. See if you can make small repairs yourself or enlist the help of a skilled friend or acquaintance. You can and should rely on your home insurance to help you avoid big financial burdens, not small annoyances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeinsurancediscountstoaskfor\">Home insurance discounts to ask for</h2>\n<p>Ask us about some of our <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-discounts/\">most common discounts</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/whats-windstorm-mitigation/\">Wind mitigation discount</a></li>\n<li>Centrally monitored security and fire alarm discount</li>\n<li>Clean claims history discount</li>\n<li><a href=\"/faq/responsible-repair-discount/\">Responsible Repair discount</a></li>\n<li>E-policy discount</li>\n</ul>"
