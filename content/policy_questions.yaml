    body: "<p>Most insurance policies come with mandatory fees, and we want to be as transparent as possible about the charges you might find in your policy. Depending on where you live, you may see the following fees: EMPA, FIGA, installment fees, inspection fees, and surplus contributions. Let’s take a look at each.</p>\n<h2 id=\"empafee\">EMPA fee</h2>\n<p>When you buy a policy from Kin and you're a Florida resident, you will see a flat $2 fee in your premium breakdown. This is the EMPA fee.</p>\n<p>This fee only applies to policyholders in Florida. By state law, a flat $2 for each Florida homeowners insurance policy sold must go toward the Emergency Management, Preparedness, and Assistance Trust Fund. This fund helps pay for emergency management activities (e.g., when a big hurricane hits and the state must quickly assist citizens).</p>\n<p>If you have a taste for legal jargon, you can read up on <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0200-0299/0252/Sections/0252.372.html\">the statute</a>.</p>\n<p>Once the policy is issued, the fee has been fully earned and is non-refundable, even if you cancel the policy shortly thereafter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"figafee\">FIGA fee</h2>\n<p>The Florida Insurance Guaranty Association, or FIGA, is a <a href=\"https://figafacts.com/frequently-asked-questions\">nonprofit organization established under Florida law</a> that protects Florida property and casualty insurance policyholders by handling any outstanding claims if their insurance company fails and becomes insolvent. Sometimes FIGA needs additional funds to resolve outstanding claims, so it periodically requires member insurance companies to collect assessment surcharge fees from their policyholders.</p>\n<p>Because several insurance carriers became insolvent, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation has ordered an <a href=\"https://figafacts.com/assessments\">additional FIGA assessment surcharge fee</a> in 2022 to cover the cost of claims left behind by failed insurance companies. The result of this assessment will cost you 1.3 percent of your total homeowners insurance premium, not including other taxes and fees.</p>\n<p>This is in addition to the 0.7 percent FIGA assessment surcharge that was implemented earlier this year - adding up to 2 percent of your premium in FIGA assessment surcharges. If you choose to pay your premium in installments, then the total fee will be added to your first payment.</p>\n<p>As required by law, this FIGA fee:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Begins on July 1, 2022.</li>\n<li>Applies to every new or renewing Florida home insurance policy with effective dates from January 1 through December 31, 2022.</li>\n<li>Lasts through June 30, 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installmentfees\">Installment fees</h2>\n<p>If you opt to pay your premium in installments – typically, the options are 1, 2, or 4 installment payment plans – <a href=\"/faq/installment-fees/\">installment fees</a> apply. The amount of the fee varies by state to account for transaction costs. For <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">homeowners insurance in Florida</a> and Louisiana, it’s $3 per installment and in California, it’s $7 per installment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inspectionfees\">Inspection fees</h2>\n<p>Most <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a> companies, especially those in catastrophe-exposed states, require a home inspection to ensure the home doesn’t have existing damage and that it meets underwriting requirements. We make this super easy by offering <a href=\"/faq/what-to-look-for-when-doing-a-home-inspection/\">self inspections</a> in Florida and <a href=\"/home-insurance/louisiana/\">Louisiana</a> that cost $15. But if you want an inspector to come to your house, an exterior inspection costs $25 and an interior and exterior inspection costs $57.</p>\n<p>In California, exterior inspections are $24, exterior and interior inspections are $44, and if you have a high-value home, the inspection is $175. A wildfire inspection is $64.</p>\n<h2 id=\"surpluscontribution\">Surplus contribution</h2>\n<p>When you buy a policy from our carrier – the Kin Interinsurance Network – the policy includes a <a href=\"/faq/surplus-contribution/\">surplus contribution</a>. This fee is approved by Florida regulators and is 10 percent of your premium. It’s used for claims and carrier operating costs only – we don’t make any money off of or take a percentage of this contribution.</p>\n<p>In fact, a surplus contribution can save you money over time. The more reserves we have to pay claims and cover operating costs, the lower we can keep our prices.</p>\n<p>This fee is refundable on a prorated basis if the policy is canceled.</p>\n<p>Our fees are never hidden – we want you to know exactly where your money goes.

    body: "<p>The death of a loved one is a challenging time, and the last thing anyone wants to do is deal with unpleasant paperwork. Unfortunately, the situation almost always creates tasks that seem trivial in the moment, but can affect you and your family later on if you don’t take care of them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Home insurance</a> is a good example. Figuring out what to do with the policy of the deceased may not be the first thing that comes to mind, but it’s an important part of ensuring everyone is protected.</p>\n<p>We outline our process for you here, but please know that our representatives are here for you. You’re more than welcome to give us a call at 855-216-7674 if you’d like someone to walk you through it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdocumentsdoineed\">What documents do I need?</h2>\n<p>We usually have to make changes to a policy when one of our customers passes away. To do this securely, we need one or more of the following documents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A copy of the death certificate for the deceased.</li>\n<li>The estate documents detailing the executor of the estate.</li>\n<li>A court-ordered estate plan from the probate process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also need to know who is the executor of the estate. All of this information can be sent by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@kin.com\">support@kin.com</a> with the name of the deceased and policy number in the subject line. (Don’t worry - we can also send an email with the request that you can simply respond to if you’d prefer.)</p>\n<p>One of the changes we’ll have to make to the policy is to update the <a href=\"/glossary/named-insured/\">named insured</a>. We do this by creating an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> that changes the name on the policy to include the phrase “Estate of.”</p>\n<p>This endorsement is an important part of protecting the property. Without that additional phrase, the estate of the named insured would likely be unable to collect any money should there be a claim on the house nor can the estate collect a refund should the policy be canceled.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> An estate cannot renew a homeowners policy, so this particular policy will expire at the end of its term.</p>\n<p>If you have another structure for handling a loved one’s estate, such as a trust, our customer service representatives can also help work through your particular situation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappensifaspouseislistedonthepolicy\">What happens if a spouse is listed on the policy?</h3>\n<p>If a spouse or another party is listed as a co-applicant or additional insured on a policy and the primary <a href=\"/glossary/policyholder/\">policyholder</a> has passed, then the steps are mostly the same. We will likely request documentation and add “Estate of” to the named insured. However, once we get the appropriate documents, we can usually list you as the named insured on the policy – although that really depends on what the estate, will, or probate process reveals. The name of the deceased typically can be removed from your policy once probate is complete.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doineedanewpolicy\">Do I need a new policy?</h2>\n<p>The next issue to cover is your arrangements for the house. We need to know how you plan to use it in order to know what kind of coverage comes next. For example, you may want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sell to a third party.</strong> In this case, we need a HUD-1 Settlement Statement from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is a standardized mortgage lending form where creditors or their closing agents list all charges imposed on buyers and sellers. When we have that, we can cancel the policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Rent the home out.</strong> Choosing to rent your property to someone else makes you a landlord, and that requires rewriting your coverage as a <a href=\"/glossary/dp3-policy/\">DP3 policy</a>. This makes it a new policy, which means it will go through the <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-underwriting-process/\">underwriting process</a>, and we’ll need an updated deed.</li>\n<li><strong>Transfer the home to a family member.</strong> We’ll need to rewrite the policy for the new owner if he or she isn't listed as a co-applicant or an <a href=\"/glossary/additional-insured/\">additional insured</a> on the original coverage. This is another situation where we need an updated deed, and we’ll send the policy through underwriting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dealing with a family death is not easy, and we understand it usually means a lot of difficult situations. At the very least, we hope we can make this one aspect a little easier for you and your loved ones.</p>"

    body: "<p>An installment fee is the small charge per payment you make on your home insurance premium. The fee covers the service cost of processing the additional payments on a monthly, quarterly, or bi-annual basis. Almost every insurance company charges this fee unless you pay for your policy in full each year.</p>\n<p>With Kin, you’ll notice you save a little more overall if you don’t pay for your policy in installments. That’s because California is charged $7 per installment payment. On <a href=\"/home-insurance/florida/\">Florida homeowners insurance</a>, there's a $3 charge per installment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howpayingforyourpolicyinfullsavesyoumoney\">How paying for your policy in full saves you money</h2>\n<p>The tiny installment fee doesn’t seem like much at first glance, but it does add up a little. If you choose a 4-pay plan for your <a href=\"/home-insurance/california/\">California home insurance,</a> for example, that’s $21 extra in processing fees (you don’t get charged for the first installment).</p>\n<p>The best way to avoid these fees? You can choose to pay for your annual premium in full. While breaking the premium up in installments may be easier to budget for in the short term, it’s important to note that it <em>doesn’t</em> save money in the long run.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whydoinsurancecompanieschargeinstallmentfees\">Why do insurance companies charge installment fees?</h2>\n<p>Insurers charge installment fees for two main reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It covers each additional credit card processing fee.</strong> Each time your insurance company runs your credit card, their servicer charges them for the transaction. Your installment fee offsets that charge.</li>\n<li><strong>It ensures they can keep offering budget-friendly installment plans.</strong> If a company didn’t charge installment fees, it would be unfair to policyholders who pay in full. For example, if you chose a 4-pay plan and your company didn’t charge a fee to cover transaction costs, the insurer would be covering $21 they didn’t cover for one-time payers.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"otherfeesyoumayseeinyourpremiumbreakdown\">Other fees you may see in your premium breakdown</h2>\n<p>Some policies include <a href=\"/faq/home-insurance-fees/\">other types of servicing fees</a>, and these vary from insurance company to insurance company and state to state. In the spirit of full transparency, here are our fees for our California homeowners insurance policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The premium.</strong> This is what your policy costs for the coverage alone.</li>\n<li><strong>MGA fee.</strong> This is a one-time administration fee for all California policies. In California, we operate as a managing general agent, and this fee allows us to offer specialized coverage we wouldn’t be able to offer otherwise.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspection fee (if applicable).</strong> If we require an <a href=\"/blog/what-is-a-4-point-insurance-inspection/\">inspection</a> in California, there is a one-time inspection fee. Exterior Inspections are $24, exterior and interior inspection are $44, and if you have a high-value home, the inspection is $175. A wildfire inspection is $64.</li>\n<li><strong>Installment fee.</strong> Again, in California, this is a flat $7 processing fee for each additional premium payment beyond the first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our fees are never hidden.

When you buy a policy, our “<a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/kin-subscribers-agreement-final.pdf\">subscriber agreement</a>” explains this relationship and the surplus contribution.</p>\n<p>Florida regulators approved the surplus contribution, and while you can’t opt out of it, it’s refundable on a prorated basis if the policy is canceled.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisapolicyholdersurplus\">What is a policyholder surplus?</h2>\n<p>A policyholder surplus is an insurance company’s admitted assets minus what it owes in claims. This is a strong indication of an insurer’s <a href=\"/about/financial-strength/\">financial strength</a> and capacity to write new policies.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-premiums-written-policyholder-surplus.asp\">greater policyholder surplus</a> means a company is financially sound – it has more assets than losses and can easily pay claims. And surplus funds can be used for exactly that: paying for claims that exceed what reinsurance will cover (and it covers a lot). In fact, our reinsurance program is so strong that the probability of surpassing these reserves is incredibly rare. Only once in every 160 years would we expect one event to exceed our program.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whataresubscribers\">What are subscribers?</h2>\n<p>Policyholder and subscriber are interchangeable terms. But because a reciprocal exchange is a true peer-to-peer insurance company, policyholders are often called subscribers or members. It’s a hat tip to the fact that when you buy a policy from a reciprocal, you are part of the company. You and your fellow subscribers are actually insuring each other, technically speaking.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/sac/\">Subscribers’ Advisory Committee</a> (SAC) protects your rights as a subscriber – you can expect us to take the required surplus, manage funds based on fiduciary rules, and conform to the <a href=\"https://6rvxtlhl.media.zestyio.com/kin-subscribers-agreement-final.pdf\">subscriber agreement</a>. Plus, the SAC ensures you have an active presence in all that we do. Think of this committee as your sounding board – they listen to your feedback to guide decisions in our resources, our improvements, and our path forward.</p>"
